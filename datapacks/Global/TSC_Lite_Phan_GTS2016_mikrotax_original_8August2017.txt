Lumping the original Cordevolian and Julian into a new extended Julian substage (e. g. KRYSTYN 1974) violates the priority without convincing faunistic reason. Very characteristic for the Cordevolian is the co-occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian elements in all fossil groups, whereas the Ladinian elements disappear around the base of the Julian. The high percentage of Ladinian elements, in addition to the first occurrence of many Carnian forms, is the reason why the Cordevolian was for a long time considered to represent the youngest substage of the Ladinian.  The Julian begins with the Trachyceras aonoides Zone, which is characterised by both the disappearance of the last Ladinian holdovers and by the appearance of numerous new Carnian or Carnian-Norian types in all stratigraphically important fossil groups, especially well recognisable in radiolarian faunas.

Lumping the original Cordevolian and Julian into a new extended Julian substage (e. g. KRYSTYN 1974) violates the priority without convincing faunistic reason. Very characteristic for the Cordevolian is the co-occurrence of Ladinian and Carnian elements in all fossil groups, whereas the Ladinian elements disappear around the base of the Julian. The high percentage of Ladinian elements, in addition to the first occurrence of many Carnian forms, is the reason why the Cordevolian was for a long time considered to represent the youngest substage of the Ladinian.

This is about 1 myr "above" the projected chron-age of Berggren et al. (1995) -- In North Atlantic Sites 558, 563 and 608 LAD of 'N. mayeri' was observed in close juxtaposition with FAD of 'N. acostaensis', essentially eliminating Foraminifer Zone N15 (=M12).  This has been varyingly interpreted as due to a hiatus in the North Atlantic (Aubry, 1993) or diachrony (ref. l,m).  Therefore, Berggren et al's assignment was C5r.2r; 11.4 Ma = C5r.2r.2.  This LAD also defined their Base of Medit. zone Mt9.  Wade et al'11 further clarify: "The extinction of Paragloborotalia mayeri has been recalibrated to 10.53 Ma as per Chaisson and Pearson (1997) (given as siakensis in Turco et al., 2002). This is significantly younger (870 kyr) than the previous reported age of 11.40 Ma in BKSA95. The interpolated age would place this event mid-C5n.2n rather than C5r.2r. The age used in BKSA95 is calibrated to the magnetostratigraphy at Site 563 (Miller et al., 1985) and this discrepancy may be due to diachrony between the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean.

NAME MEANING= Latin "Homo", meaning man, and the Neander Valley in Gernamy where the first major specimen was discovered (the German word for Valley being "Tal" or "Thal" and thus giving "Neadnerthal", or "Man from the Neander Valley").. DESCRIPTION= Related, but not a direct ancestor to Homo sapiens. Thought to have evolved in Europe from European Homo heidelbergensis around 300 kya. They were well adapted to cold and dry environments, being shorter and stockier than modern humans. They had an average cranial capacity of 1500 ml, compared to modern human's average of 1350. This may also have been an adaptation to the cold, as populations that live in colder climates are known to have larger brains. They also had a thick brow ridge, receeding forehead, an occipital bun, and a depression called the "suprainic fossa" where strong neck muscles would have been attached. Their bones were thicker and stronger than modern humans, their teeth were larger, and their pelvises were wider. Their DNA has also been studied, and genes for red hair, pale skin, and even genes related to language ability have been found.. DIET= They ate large amounts of meat supplimented with vegetable matter. However, despite this mixed diet, many Neadnerthal skeletons show evidence of nutrient deficiency. There is also some debatable evidence of cannibalism.. CULTURE= Associated with the Mousterian tool technology, however near the end of their time, they developed more advanced stone tool technology similar to the microblade technology used by early Homo sapiens.  This happened roughly at the same time that modern humans first entered Europe.  It is thought that they learned to make these tools by copying Homo sapiens, or they traded for them. Neanderthals had control of fire for cooking, heat, and protection from wild animals. They wore skins for clothes, especially in colder areas, however these skins were probably wrapped around the body and tied in place.  They were also known to occasionally wear jewelry such as pendants and other limited types of body decoration.  They seem to have buried their dead most of the time, and some artifacts have been discovered that might have been grave goods, however it is still difficult to say if this was ritualized behavior or not.  ENVIRONMENT= The Neanderthals lived in a variety of environments and across multiple periods of warming and cooling.  LOCATION= Europe and the Middle East.  Important sites include Le Moustier, La Ferrassie, and La Chapelle-aux-saints in France, Amud in Israel, and the Neander Valley in Germany.

Fossils are found in a broad range of locations including sites at Kabwe, Ndutu, and Bodo in Africa, Boxgrove, Steinhelm, and Mauer in Europe, and Dali, Maba, and Narmada in Asia.. DIET= They seem to have eaten large amounts of meat, preferring to hunt larger animals such as rhinos, bears, horses, and deer.. CULTURE= Later Homo heidelbergensis populations are associated with the Levallios stone tool technology, a method of stone working where a core is carefully prepared, and flakes of a uniform size and shape are chipped off. They are also known to have used tools made from antler, bone, and wood. Early Homo heidelbergensis used much the same technology as Homo erectus, where large stone tools were made by removing flakes from both sides to make a bifacial hand axe, cleaver, or carver. Homo heidelbergensis seems to have used these tools primarily for hunting and butchering animals. They use fire, however it is difficult to say whether it was a controlled use of fire or not. While there is no direct evidence of clothing, it seems likely that they wore hides to keep warm, especially in Europe where it was colder.. ENVIRONMENT= 600-200 kya, Europe and Africa went through a series of cool and warm phases. The move to Europe from Africa would have further introduced Homo heidelbergensis to colder climates as well. Approximately 300 kya there was a severe cold and dry period, during which the Sahara expanded, becoming a barrier to travel between Eurasia and Africa.

EVENT
	Hobbit (H. floresiensis)	0.02		"DESCRIPTION: "Discovered by an Australian/Indonesian team in 2003 at the Liang Bua cave on the Indonesian island of Flores. This find is an almost complete skull and a partial skeleton. LB1 was an adult, probably female, about 1 meter (3'3") tall with an extremely small brain size of 417cc. The fossil is 18,000 years old and was found with stone tools. This species may be a dwarf form of Homo erectus.   REF= http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/flores"
	Peking Man (H. erectus)	0.4		"DESCRIPTION: "Between 1929 and 1937, 14 partial craniums, 11 lower jaws, many teeth, some skeletal bones and large numbers of stone tools were discovered in the Lower Cave at Locality 1 of the Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian (formerly Choukoutien), near Beijing (formerly Peking), in China. Their age is estimated to be between 500,000 and 300,000 years old." (extract from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/peking"

	Turkana Boy (H. ergaster)	1.6		"DESCRIPTION: "Turkana Boy is an almost complete skeleton of ca. 11-year-old boy, the only major omissions being the hands and feet. (If H. ergaster matured faster than modern humans, then he was only about 8-9 years old). It is the most complete known specimen of H. ergaster (the first early human with long legs, short arms and a tall stature-body proportions essentially like our own), and also one of the oldest, at 1.6 million years."

	Lucy (A. afarensis)	3.2		"DESCRIPTION: "Lucy was an adult female of about 25 years and was assigned to the species Australopithecus afarensis. About 40% of her skeleton was found, and her pelvis, femur (the upper leg bone) and tibia show her to have been bipedal, although there is evidence that afarensis was also partly arboreal (tree-dwelling)." (extract from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/lucy"
	Ardi (A. ramidus)	4.4		"DESCRIPTION: "Ardi, first find of Ardipithecus ramidus, is a spectacularly complete fossil dated as 4.4 Ma. About 45% of her skeleton was found, including most of the skull, pelvis, hands and feet, and many limb bones. She was about 120 cm (3'11") tall and weighed about 50 kg (110 lbs).  Discovered by a team led by Tim White in 1994 at Aramis in Ethiopia, and published in Science in 2009. The skull and brain are small, about the size of a chimpanzee. It was bipedal on the ground, though not as well adapted to bipedalism as the australopithecines were, and quadrupedal in the trees. It lived in a woodland environment with patches of forest, indicating that bipedalism did not originate in a savannah environment." (extract from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/ardi"

Adjusted Tropical SST	point	150	0/255/255			Different sources; but using Oxygen-to-Temp conversion from Veizer-Prokoph 2015.  LATE CRET has an overlay of TEX86 temperature estimates (much higher).  TRIASSIC = Veizer-Prokoph 2015 have this 25C as 20C for end-Rhaetian cooling after empiracl compensation for Phanerozoic ocean Oxy-18 trends => 5C less for their smoothing (4C used here).

Phanerozoic-Proterozoic Carbon-13 Composite (per-mil PDB)	point	200	250/250/250			CENOZOIC (0-70 Ma) = Derived from Cramer (2009) -- See Saltzman and Thomas (GTS2012 Carbon-isotope chapter); but only every 10th item from 9-point averaging of Benthic foraminifer compilation (29000 data points in original) is shown here; NOTE:  Cramer had two sets -- original and adjusted" (which removed many of the original)); LATE CRET (70-100 Ma) = Composite English Chalk by Jarvis et al. (2006) plus Camp-Maastr boundary from Voight et al. (2010); EARLY CRET (100-145 Ma) = Gale et al. (2011; Cret. Res.), Herrle et al. (2004, EPSL), Renard et al. (2005) and Follmi et al (2006, Paleoceanography) and Martinez et al. (2015); JURASSIC (145-200 Ma) = mainly Katz et al. 2005 (in Muttoni et al., 2014) enhanced by Glowniak and Wierzbowski (2007) for mid-Oxf, Pellanard et al. (2014) for Callov-Oxf boundary; Jenkyns (2004) for Bathonian-Aalenian, Kemp et al. (2005)and Bodin et al. (2010) for early Toarcian.  TRIASSIC = Data from Suppl. to Muttoni et al. (2014) for upper Ladinian through uppermost Rhaetian, which had sudden jump upward to Jurassic of Katz et al., 2005 (used here, pending Jurassic chart scaling).  BUT -- THEY IGNORE MOST PREVIOUS STUDIES; ONLY USE THEIR SINGLE-SECTION SETS.  Early Triassic-lowermost Ladinian from Sun et al (2012) as cycle-adjusted by Mingsong Li.  NO data for upper Anisian.

The bolide impacted at a speed of many kilometers per second, punching a deep hole through the sediments and into the granite continental basement rock. The bolide itself was completely vaporised, with the basement rock being fractured to depths of 8 kilometers, and a 'peak ring' being raised around it.  Extensive tektite strewnfield beyond.  The deep crater, 38 km across, is surrounded by a flat-floored terrace-like ring trough with an outer edge of collapsed blocks forming ring faults.

The Popigai crater in Siberia, Russia is tied with Manicouagan Reservoir as the 4th largest impact crater on Earth. A large bolide impact created the 100-kilometer diameter crater at 35.7 ± 0.2 Ma during the late Eocene (Priabonian stage). The shock pressures from the impact instantaneously transformed graphite in the ground into diamonds within a 13.6 kilometer radius of the impact point. Diamonds are usually 0.5 to 2 millimeters in diameter; a few exceptional specimens are 10 millimeters in size. The diamonds not only inherit the tabular shape of the original graphite grains but they additionally preserve the original crystal's delicate striations. Diam.(km): 100"

The impact caused some of the largest megatsunamis in Earth's history. A cloud of dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater, as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second. Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry, broiling the Earth's surface and igniting global wildfires; meanwhile, shock waves spawned global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things to survive in. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a dramatic greenhouse effect. Another consequence of the impact is that sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. Diam.(km): 170"

The Kara crater lies in the southeastern end of the Yugorsky Peninsula, while the Ust-Kara site lies offshore, 15 km east of the small Kara or Karskaya Guba inlet. It was formerly believed that these two sites were two separate craters and that they formed a twin impact structure from a large-scale meteorite hit in the late cretaceous. However, it seems that the Ust-Kara site does not exist as a separate site. Apparently, the Suevite outcrops of the Ust-Kara impact structure are only a part of the Kara impact structure.

Fifth largest impact crater known on earth.  Manicouagan Reservoir lies within the remnant of an ancient eroded impact crater (astrobleme). The crater was formed following the impact of a 5¾kilometres (3¾miles) diameter asteroid which excavated a crater originally about 100¾km (62¾mi) wide although erosion and deposition of sediments have since reduced the visible diameter to about 72¾km (45¾mi).

An evolutionary radiation within marine microorganisms (acritarchs) occurs just above the level as the ejecta layer, and some authors believe there may be a connection. The crater is deeply eroded and its original size must be inferred by indirect means. Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to 85_90 km, while other suggest a smaller size, perhaps only 35_40 km, closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centered. The larger size estimate would imply an energy release of 5.2 x 10^6 megatons of TNT. The ejecta contains shocked minerals and small shatter cones, is composed of rock similar in age and composition to that at the crater, and is associated with an iridium anomaly suggesting contamination with extraterrestrial material.

The current Sudbury Basin i(62 km long, 30 km wide, 15 km deep) is believed to be a smaller portion of a 250 km round crater that the bolide originally created.    It was created by a 10 km meteorite impact, 1.85 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. Debris was scattered over an area of 1.6 million square kilometers and travelled over 800 kilometers away.
