	Pleistocene	2.588		Major expansion of N.Hemis. glaciation begins near Guss/Matuyama boundary [accepted in 2009 for base of "Quaternary", hence base of revised "Pleistocene"].  Gelasian stage was transferred to Pleistocene series by IUGS/ICS/INQUA (submitted May 2007; but was not ratified by IUGS until summer 2009 after another round of ICS voting and resubmission).  This enabled formalization of the Quaternary as an official system of the international scale.	255/242/174
	Pliocene	5.333		PLIOCENE --  Base of Pliocene is traditionally placed at base of Trubi Formation (base of Zanclean Stage) representing restoration of marine conditions in the Mediterranean following the late Miocene (Messinian) dessication.  This event occurs 5 precession cycles below the Thvera (C3n.4n) Polarity Subchron, or at 5.32 Ma [Hilgen and Langereis, 1993, "A critical re-evaluation of the Miocene/Pliocene boundary as defined in the Mediterranean", Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 118: 167-179]. 	255/255/153
	Miocene	23.03		Base of Miocene (base of Neogene Period) = base of Chron C6Cn.2n. The GSSP of the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is defined as 35m level of Rigorosa Formation in the Lemme-Carrosio sections of NE Italy, corresponding also to the FAD of Foram Globorotalia kugleri (base of Foram Zone M1) (Berggren et al., 1995; Steininger et al., in press)	255/255/0
	Oligocene	33.89		Eocene/Oligocene boundary is defined at Massignano (central Italy) at the LAD of Hantkenina spp. and calibrated to magnetics, plus dated by ash beds as ca. 33.7 Ma.  Base of Rupellian is at Chron C13r.86.  Essentially, the "top of Eocene" is defined by a LAD, rather than a "base of Oligocene" (e.g., using an FAD).	253/192/122
	Eocene	55.96		Base of Eocene is ca. C24r.36 (decision of Paleogene-chapter group for GTS2012).  Base of Eocene is 0.94 myr (0.98 in another table) above top C25n according to cycle stratigraphy.  This is NOT tied proportionally within Chron C24r; but some indicate it as C24r.36 (e.g., used in Agnini et al'07 for calibrating nannofossil datums near boundary).  Age used here is from U-Pb => 0.05 myr lower.	253/180/108
	Paleocene	66.04		Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary event is approx. Chron C29r.5 in total C29r span of ca. 710 kyr, according to cycles; Husson et al., 2011; Thibault et al., submitted)	253/167/95
	Late	100.5		Base-Cenomanian is base of foraminifer Rotalipora globotruncanoides, which is 6m lower than base of M. mantelli ammonite Zone at the GSSP section.  The uppermost part of the N. caractanense Subzone (basal Subzone of Cenomanian) is ~99.8 ﾱ0.37 Ma (Obradovich et al., 2002), and cycle stratigraphy scaling of its duration (0.44 myr) = 100.25 Ma, and a slight 0.25 offset to the GSSP marker below implies the base of the Cenomanian is 100.5 ﾱ0.4 Ma.	166/216/74
	Early	145.01	dashed	Base of Cretaceous (base of Berriasian) working version is Base of Chron M18r.  This is higher than B. jacobi (Tethyan ammonite zone).	140/205/87
	Late	163.47		Base of Q. mariae ammonite zone.  GSSP is not yet decided, but this level at Redcliff (England) candidate has been correlated to 25% up in Chron M37n.1n of Deep-tow extension to M-Sequence.	179/227/238

The current GSSP does not coincide with the base of the Cyrtograptus centrifugus Biozone, as was supposed when the GSSP was defined. Restudy recommends a slightly higher and correlatable level on conodonts -- the Ireviken datum 2, which coincides approximately with the base of the murchisoni Graptolite Biozone (about 0.1 myr higher).	179/225/194

	Early	5.333		PLIOCENE --  Base of Pliocene is traditionally placed at base of Trubi Formation (base of Zanclean Stage) representing restoration of marine conditions in the Mediterranean following the late Miocene (Messinian) dessication.  This event occurs 5 precession cycles below the Thvera (C3n.4n) Polarity Subchron, or at 5.32 Ma [Hilgen and Langereis, 1993, "A critical re-evaluation of the Miocene/Pliocene boundary as defined in the Mediterranean", Earth Planet.

	Early	23.03		Base of Miocene (base of Neogene Period) = base of Chron C6Cn.2n. The GSSP of the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is defined as 35m level of Rigorosa Formation in the Lemme-Carrosio sections of NE Italy, corresponding also to the FAD of Foram Globorotalia kugleri (base of Foram Zone M1) (Berggren et al., 1995; Steininger et al., in press)	255/255/51
	Late	28.09	dashed	Base of Chattian (Early/Late Oligocene boundary ) has not been defined (as of 2011).  Base of Chattian (working version) base of Chron C10n.1n (same as GTS08).  [NOTE: Base is potentially at ~70% up in "undifferentiated Chron C10n" in candidate GSSP in Italy (Coccioni et al., 2008), which would project as equivalent to C10n.1n.4.]  Potentially at 2/3rds up in undifferentiated Chron C10n in candidate GSSP in Italy (Coccioni et al., 2008).  Assigned in GTS08 as base of Chron C10n.1n = Foram Zone P21a/P21b boundary (=LAD of common Chiloguembelina occurrence => last occurrence defines top of Rupelian, rather than an FAD defining base of Chattian) following Berggren et al. (1995).  Ideally, this level would be at the base of polarity chron (C9r or C10n.1n), which provides a global marker.	254/230/170
	Early	33.89		Eocene/Oligocene boundary is defined at Massignano (central Italy) at the LAD of Hantkenina spp. and calibrated to magnetics, plus dated by ash beds as ca. 33.7 Ma.  Base of Rupellian is at Chron C13r.86.  Essentially, the "top of Eocene" is defined by a LAD, rather than a "base of Oligocene" (e.g., using an FAD).	254/217/154
	Late	37.75	dashed	Base of Priabonian assigned here as base of Chron C17n.1n.  However; at Alano (candidate GSSP section in Italy), the RARE FAD of C. oamaruensis and proposed GSSP level is 10% up in C17n.2n (about 0.3 myr older)	253/205/161
	Middle	47.84		Base of Lutetian is Chron C21r.6 (decision of Paleogene-chapter group of GTS2012).  Base of Lutetian (GSSP ratified Feb 2011) is base of nannofossil Blackites inflatus at Gorrondatxe section in Spain.  This level is 39 precession cycles (0.78myr if 20 kyr; 0.819 if 21 kyr) above base of Chron C21r at Otsakar section near GSSP one (using 20kyr/cycle for average precession at 50 Ma = computation used here => this is at C21r.77 using GTS2012 spline.  NOTE:  Using Lutetian GSSP proposal's assignment of "uncertain = R" at top of C21r (as they indicate with their labeled C21n/C21r level), then this was lower -- 40% up in C21r -- age from spline-fit with cycles.  Therefore, this is about 0.78 myr above the GTS04 working placement as base of C21r (following Berggren et al'95)	252/180/130
	Early	55.96		Base of Eocene is ca. C24r.36 (decision of Paleogene-chapter group for GTS2012).  Base of Eocene is 0.94 myr (0.98 in another table) above top C25n according to cycle stratigraphy.  This is NOT tied proportionally within Chron C24r; but some indicate it as C24r.36 (e.g., used in Agnini et al'07 for calibrating nannofossil datums near boundary).  Age used here is from U-Pb => 0.05 myr lower.	252/167/115
	Late	59.24		Base of Thanetian (Ratified by ICS/IUGS (Spr'08):  Base of magnetic polarity Chron C26n = same as temporary assignment in GTS2004 (GSSP in Zumaya, Spain), as in Berggren et al., 1995	253/191/111
	Middle	61.61		Ratified by ICS/IUGS (Spr'08):  Onset of a carbon isotope shift and sea-level drop (Exxon/Hardenbol sequence boundary "Sel1"); near diversification of the Fasciculith group of calcareous nannoplankton, preceding the lowest Fasciculithus tympaniformis (base of nannoplankton zone NP5).  Approximately 0.58 myr (ca. 32 precession cycles) above the base of magnetic polarity Chron C26r.  [Revised definition is about 0.6 myr younger than GTS04 provisional version (which was base of Chron C26r)]  (61.1Ma -- BUT SHOULD BE 61.0 Ma in GTS04 magscale) 	254/191/101

	Priabonian	37.75	dashed	Base of Priabonian assigned here as base of Chron C17n.1n.  However; at Alano (candidate GSSP section in Italy), the RARE FAD of C. oamaruensis and proposed GSSP level is 10% up in C17n.2n (about 0.3 myr older)	253/205/161
	Bartonian	41.15	dashed	Base of Bartonian (working version) assigned as base of Chron C18r.  The base of Bartonian is typically correlated to a level within Nanno Zone NP16, and closely associated with LAD of Reticulofenestra reticulata (Leg 320-321 cite same chron-age scaling as chron-age scaling as Berggren et al.

	Lutetian	47.84		Base of Lutetian is Chron C21r.6 (decision of Paleogene-chapter group of GTS2012).  Base of Lutetian (GSSP ratified Feb 2011) is base of nannofossil Blackites inflatus at Gorrondatxe section in Spain.  This level is 39 precession cycles (0.78myr if 20 kyr; 0.819 if 21 kyr) above base of Chron C21r at Otsakar section near GSSP one (using 20kyr/cycle for average precession at 50 Ma = computation used here => this is at C21r.77 using GTS2012 spline.  NOTE:  Using Lutetian GSSP proposal's assignment of "uncertain = R" at top of C21r (as they indicate with their labeled C21n/C21r level), then this was lower -- 40% up in C21r -- age from spline-fit with cycles.  Therefore, this is about 0.78 myr above the GTS04 working placement as base of C21r (following Berggren et al'95)	252/180/130
	Ypresian	55.96		Base of Eocene is ca. C24r.36 (decision of Paleogene-chapter group for GTS2012).  Base of Eocene is 0.94 myr (0.98 in another table) above top C25n according to cycle stratigraphy.  This is NOT tied proportionally within Chron C24r; but some indicate it as C24r.36 (e.g., used in Agnini et al'07 for calibrating nannofossil datums near boundary).  Age used here is from U-Pb => 0.05 myr lower.	252/167/115
	Thanetian	59.24		Base of Thanetian (Ratified by ICS/IUGS (Spr'08):  Base of magnetic polarity Chron C26n = same as temporary assignment in GTS2004 (GSSP in Zumaya, Spain), as in Berggren et al., 1995	253/191/111

Approximately 0.58 myr (ca. 32 precession cycles) above the base of magnetic polarity Chron C26r.  [Revised definition is about 0.6 myr younger than GTS04 provisional version (which was base of Chron C26r)]  (61.1Ma -- BUT SHOULD BE 61.0 Ma in GTS04 magscale) 	254/191/101
	Danian	66.04		Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary event is approx. Chron C29r.5 in total C29r span of ca. 710 kyr, according to cycles; Husson et al., 2011; Thibault et al., submitted)	253/180/98
	Maastrichtian	72.05		Cobban et al., 2006 "However, in regard to the sequence at Tercis, France, which has the Global Standard Stratotype Section and Point for the Campanian-Maastrichtian Stage boundary, the base of the Maastrichtian should be placed high in the Baculites eliasi Zone (Walaszczyk et al., 2002). The latter placement of the boundary is accepted ...[NOTE: Their summary table had as Top, hence base of Baculites baculus, used here]. Odin (2001) considered base-Maastrichtian GSSP to project to near base of N.Amer. B. jenseni ammonite zone.  Cobban's zonation of 1993 had estimated base-Campanian (prior to setting of GSSP) was approximately at base of B. eliasi ammonite zone.

Therefore, if this highest occurrence of Q. trifidum is synchronous with its position at 16 m above the GSSP at Tercis, then the estimated sediment accumulation rate of 25 m/myr in this Tercis interval indicates that the underling GSSP level is 0.75 myr prior to this age (Odin, 2001), or at approximately 70.6 Ma.

	Campanian	83.64	dashed	Base-Campanian is the extinction of crinoid Marsupites testudinarius (provisional boundary marker).  For this scale, we have assumed equivalence with base of S. leei III ammonite Zone of Western Interior.	230/244/127
	Santonian	86.26	dashed	85.85 retained as 85.8 in GTS04; GSSP not yet decided	217/239/116
	Coniacian	89.77	dashed	The base of the Coniacian Stage is the lowest occurrence of the Cremnoceramus rotundatus (sensu Trﾚger non Fiege) inoceramid bivalve.  In GTS04, this inoceramid datum had been considered to be slightly older (suggested by U. Kaplan, in northern Germany) than the lowest occurrence of ammonite Forresteria petrocoriensis, which had a spline-fit age of 89.07 Ma.  Therefore, the base-Coniacian had been estimated as 89.3 Ma.  However, it is now known from inoceramid-ammonite calibration studies that the onset of the F. petrocoriensis zone (or Foresteria peruuana zone) is in late Turonian, and the Coniacian as defined above begins approximately at the base of the overlying Scaphites preventricosus ammonite zone (age of 88.58 Ma in GTS04; which had been used as the Early/Middle Coniacian boundary level !!).  Other than the inoceramid datum and associated base-Coniacian GSSP age, this correction does not alter any of the assigned ages for any other biostratigraphic or other stratigraphic events.   [NOTE: 88.58 rounds off to 88.6]	204/233/104
	Turonian	93.9		The base of the Turonian Stage is at the base of Bed 86 of the Bridge Creek Limestone Member, west of Pueblo, Colorado, USA. The GSSP coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonite Watinoceras devonense, is in the middle of a global positive excursion in carbon 13 isotopes, and is bracketed by widespread bentonites that have yielded age of 93.79 to 93.96 Ma; and cycle-extrapolated as 93.90 ﾱ0.15 myr (Meyers et al., AGU, 2010; and submitted to Geology, 2011).  Cycle-strat duration = 0.35 myr (Meyers et al., EPSL, 2011 in press); contains bentonite dated as 93.79 ﾱ0.26 Ma in upper part of this zone.	191/227/93
	Cenomanian	100.5		Base-Cenomanian is base of foraminifer Rotalipora globotruncanoides, which is 6m lower than base of M. mantelli ammonite Zone at the GSSP section.  The uppermost part of the N. caractanense Subzone (basal Subzone of Cenomanian) is ~99.8 ﾱ0.37 Ma (Obradovich et al., 2002), and cycle stratigraphy scaling of its duration (0.44 myr) = 100.25 Ma, and a slight 0.25 offset to the GSSP marker below implies the base of the Cenomanian is 100.5 ﾱ0.4 Ma.	179/222/83
	Albian	112.95	dashed	DASH -- Base of schrammeni zone (lowest of 3 Leymeriella zones) = base of Albian in NW Germany regional macrofossil system = very close to FAD of P. columnata (subcircular) according to Mutterlose et al. (2003, Cretaceous Research) = our base of Albian stage.  However, this level is probably significantly BELOW the base-tardefurcata in SE France (Tethyan).  The U-Pb age of 113.0 ﾱ0.3 Ma from this level in Germany implies that it should not be that far above the FAD P. columnata cycle-strat age of GTS2012 (112.95 Ma ﾱ0.4 myr) => arbitrary placed as that level.	204/234/151

	Barremian	130.77		Base of Barremian (base of Spitidiscus hugii ammonite zone) assigned here as Chron M5n(0.8)	179/223/127
	Hauterivian	133.88		The base of the Hauterivian (base of Acanthodiscus radiatus ammonite zone of Tethyan realm) is considered to be near the beginning of chron M10n (e.g., Weissert and others), as supported by later studies (e.g, McArthur et al., 2007, Palaeo-3), and consistent with the cycle-scaled duration of the Valanginian.  Assigned as base M10n.  In GTS04, the base of the Hauterivian Stage has been assigned, based on the reported occurrence of its earliest ammonites, to near the beginning of magnetic polarity chron M11n (Channell et al., 1995, EPSL).  However, the GTS04 authors and reviewers were not aware that this published correlation had been revised.  In GTS04; the Base of Hauterivian was assigned as base of Chron M11n.  Earlier version -- Valanginian/Hauterivian boundary is within M10Nr or within the adjacent normal-polarity chrons; tentatively assigned to middle of M10Nr.	166/217/117
	Valanginian	139.39		Base of Valanginian (base of Tirnovella pertransiens ammonite zone in Tethyan Realm) is assigned here as Chron M14r(0.3).  T. otopeta, formerly basal Valanginian, is now assigned to Berriasian.  Note that the Berriasian is much shorter in duration in GTS2004, even with this transfer of an ammonite zone.  This reflects the postulated faster spreading model (and dropping of U-Pb date of 137 reported for uppermost Berriasian), hence Pacific anomalies represent shorter time.	153/211/106
	Berriasian	145.01	dashed	Base of Cretaceous (base of Berriasian) working version is Base of Chron M18r.  This is higher than B. jacobi (Tethyan ammonite zone).	140/205/96

	Oxfordian	163.47		Base of Q. mariae ammonite zone.  GSSP is not yet decided, but this level at Redcliff (England) candidate has been correlated to 25% up in Chron M37n.1n of Deep-tow extension to M-Sequence.	191/231/241
	Callovian	166.07		Base of B. bullatus ammonite zone.  GSSP is not yet decided.  In magnetostratigraphy from the Albstadt-Pfeffingen GSSP candidate (Swabia, Germany), this level is the base of a brief normal-polarity zone, which is interpreted to be the base of marine magnetic anomaly M39n.3n in the Deep-Tow extension to M-Sequence (using mid-depth projection)	191/231/229
	Bathonian	168.28		Base of Z. zigzag  ammonite zone at Ravin du Bﾏs-Bas Auran (France).

	Bajocian	170.3		Base of H. discites ammonite zone at Cabo Mondego (Portugal).  In combined magnetostratigraphy of Spain and Switzerland, this level is in the uppermost part (ca. 80% up) of a reversed-polarity-dominated zone, which is interpreted to be marine magnetic anomaly M44n.1r in the Deep-Tow extension to M-Sequence (using mid-depth projection)	166/221/224

	E	89.77	dashed	The base of the Coniacian Stage is the lowest occurrence of the Cremnoceramus rotundatus (sensu Trﾚger non Fiege) inoceramid bivalve.  In GTS04, this inoceramid datum had been considered to be slightly older (suggested by U. Kaplan, in northern Germany) than the lowest occurrence of ammonite Forresteria petrocoriensis, which had a spline-fit age of 89.07 Ma.  Therefore, the base-Coniacian had been estimated as 89.3 Ma.  However, it is now known from inoceramid-ammonite calibration studies that the onset of the F. petrocoriensis zone (or Foresteria peruuana zone) is in late Turonian, and the Coniacian as defined above begins approximately at the base of the overlying Scaphites preventricosus ammonite zone (age of 88.58 Ma in GTS04; which had been used as the Early/Middle Coniacian boundary level !!).  Other than the inoceramid datum and associated base-Coniacian GSSP age, this correction does not alter any of the assigned ages for any other biostratigraphic or other stratigraphic events.

However, the base-Pleistocene was proposed in 2007 by ICS/INQUA (and ratified by IUGS in July 2009) to be lowered to include the Gelasian Stage (see next GSSP).  The traditional name "Calabrian" was officially accepted by ICS in Feb, 2011 (although it had already been voted approval in 2007 as part of the first Quaternary package to IUGS); and sent to IUGS in March 2011 for ratification.

This point coincides closely with the first regular occurrence of the planktonic foraminifer Globorotalia miotumida and the first occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil Amaurolithus delicatus, and falls within the interval of reversed polarity that corresponds to C3Br.1r. The base of the reddish layer and, thus, the Messinian GSSP has been assigned an astronomical age of 7.251Ma (later revised to 7.246).

	*__*	163.47	dashed	Potential Oxfordian GSSP may coincide with ammonite Brightia thuouxensis Horizon at base of the Cardioceras scarburgense Subzone (defines base of Quenstedtoceras mariae Zone).
	*__*	166.07	dashed	Potential Callovian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of ammonite genus Kepplerites (Kosmoceratidae) (defines base of Macrocephalites herveyi Zone in sub-Boreal province of Great Britain to southwest Germany).
	*__*	182.7	dashed	Potential Toarcian GSSP at Peniche, Portugal, coincides with lowest occurrence of a diversified Eodactylites ammonite fauna; and correlates with the NW European Paltus horizon.
	*__*	209.46	dashed	Potential Rhaetian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of ammonite Cochlocera, conodonts Misikella spp. and Epigondolella mosheri, and radiolarian Proparvicingula moniliformis.
	*__*	228.35	dashed	Potential Norian GSSP may coincide with base of Klamathites macrolobatus or Stikinoceras kerri ammonoid zones and the Metapolygnathus communisti or M. primitius conodont zones.
	*__*	247.06	dashed	The base-Anisian working group has proposed the profound conodont turnover including lowest occurrences of Chiosella (Cs. Gondolloides).  GTS2004 had used an ammonite placement near the higher FAD of Cs. timorensis.  [NOTE: new U-Pb ages on this level yield an age closer to 249 Ma]
	*__*	250.01	dashed	Olenekian/Induan working group decision (Nov07) is the lowest occurrence of conodont Neospathodus waageni s.l., just above base of Rohillites rohilla ammonite zone.  This is  slightly different than in GTS2004 (FAD of Hedenstroemia or Meekoceras gracilitatis ammonites).  Base-Olenekian age derived by cycle-scaling from base-Triassic (fixed as 251Ma; although new U-Pb ages yield ca. 252.3 Ma for that P/Tr level)
	*__*	279.33	dashed	Potential Kungurian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Neostreptognathus pnevi-N. exculptus.
	*__*	290.06	dashed	Potential Artinskian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Sweetognathus whitei.
	*__*	295.53	dashed	Potential Sakmarian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Sweetognathus merrelli.
	*__*	303.67	dashed	Working group definition is lowest occurrence of Idiognathodus simulator sensu stricto; rather than the Near lowest occurrences of the fusulinids Daixina, Jigulites and Rugosofusulina used in GTS2004.  Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07), relative to base-Permian, which is consistent with U-Pb dating by Mark Schmitz (presented at Nanjing Perm-Carb congress, June 07).
	*__*	306.99	dashed	The current preferred definition by working group is the base of the Protriticites pseudomontiparus-Obsoletes obsoletus conodont zone (equals base of Swadelina neoshoensis zone) .  GTS04 had used base of Obsoletes obsoletes and Protriticites pseudomontiparus fusulinid zone.   Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07) = MFS of Farlington cycle (Lower Suvorova) relative to base-Permian.
	*__*	315.16	dashed	Potential Moscovian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrences of conodonts Declinognathodus donetzianus and/or Idiognathoides postsulcatus, and of fusulinid Aljutovella aljutovica.
	*__*	330.92	dashed	In GTS04, the base of the Serpukhovian Stage had been assigned an age of 326 Ma based on a tentative working definition of the first appearance of the conodont Lochriea cruciformis.  The boundary working group decided that the first evolutionary appearance of the conodont Lochriea ziegleri in the lineage Lochriea nodosa - Lochriea ziegleri presents the best potential for an international definition of the boundary.
	*__*	489.5	dashed	Potential TENTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Lotagnostus americanus.
	*__*	509	dashed	Potential FIFTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Oryctocephalus indicus.
	*__*	514	dotted	Potential FOURTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Olenellus or Redlichia.
	*__*	521	dashed	Potential THIRD Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of Trilobites.
	*__*	529	dotted	Potential SECOND Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of Small Shelly Fossils, or Archaeocyathid species.

Geomagnetic Polarity	chron					GTS2012 composites for Cenozoic-Late Jurassic C- and M-sequences from chapter on geomagnetic polarity time scale; Middle-Early Jurassic is outcrop compilation (see GTS2012 chapter); Late Triassic Newark provided by Dennis Kent in June 2005 (after Kent and Olsen, 1999) tied to CAMP basalts at top-Triassic, Middle and Early Triassic outcrop after Hounslow and Muttoni (2010) and Szurlies (2007), Late Permian after Steiner (2006).  Early Permian-Ordovician = modified slightly from compilations in GTS04 and GTS08 Concise GTS (e.g., Ordov-Late Camb = Pavlov and Gallet, 2005); but Late Cambrian revised in GTS2012 by Peng and Babcock.  Middle and Early Camb = Kirschvink and Rozanov, 1984; Kirschvink, 1978 as revised by Peng and Babcock in GTS2012.

Newark series	Primary		Newark series from table of cycle-scaled ages relative to 202 Ma just above base of E24n.  Kent and Olsen (Astronomically tuned geomagnetic polarity timescale for the Late Triassic; JGR, 104: 12831-12841, 1999).  Numbering begins with lowest N (E1n), with R's above N's.

DASH as Coeval with middle of Magadiceramus crenelatus Inoceramid zone (Andy Gale, chart to J.Ogg, Aug2011) => below "Santonian" of N.Amer. zonation usage.  GTS04 -- Santonian has a single "polyopsis" ammonite Zone in Boreal/Tethyan realms.
	Paratexanites serratomarginatus	88.36	dashed	Same as SubBoreal = DASH at about 90% up in Volviceramus koeneni Inoceramid zone (chart of Andy Gale, sent to J.Ogg; Aug2011).  GTS04 = Set equal to age of base of N.Amer. S.depressus Zone.
	Gauthiericeras margae	89.02	dashed	Same as SubBoreal = DASH at zone below Volviceramus koeneni Inoceramid zone (chart of Andy Gale, sent to J.Ogg; Aug2011; can't quite read level).  GTS04 = Uncertain basal age; and arbitrarily put in middle of "Middle" Coniacian.
	Peroniceras tridorsatum	89.77		0
	Subprionocyclus neptuni	90.86		LINKED TO BOREAL (below) == same zonation
	Collignoniceras woollgari	92.9		Same level as base-C. woollgari in N.Amer. = 93.72 ﾱ0.5 within this zone.  Age an Duration = based on basal-age from cycle-strat from below; and upper age from spline-fit from above.

	Calycoceras guerangeri	95.24		Base of D.problematicum Zone of N.Amer. (Andy Gale diagram to J.Ogg; Aug2011).  GTS04 =  Assigned as coeval with base of N.Amer. Calycoceras canitaurinum - Dunveganoceras pondi Zone.
	Acanthoceras jukesbrownei	95.47		Base of D.pondi Zone of N.Amer. (Andy Gale diagram to J.Ogg; Aug2011).  GTS04 =  Base assigned as coeval with base of N.Amer. Acanthoceras amphibolum Zone.
	Acanthoceras rhotomagense	96.08		Assigned as coeval with base of N.Amer. Acanthoceras granerosense Zone.
	Cunningtoniceras inerme	96.24		Base assigned as coeval with base of N.Amer. C. tarrantense-C. gilberti Zone.
	Mantelliceras dixoni	98.37		DASH Base = middle of E. Cenomanian
	Mantelliceras mantelli	100.25		The top of N. carcitanense subzone (basal subzone of Cenomanian) is ~99.1 ﾱ0.4 Ma (Obradovich et al., 2002), and cycle stratigraphy scaling of its duration (0.44 myr) and a slight offset to the GSSP marker below implies the base of the Cenomanian is 99.6 ﾱ0.4 Ma.
	Arrhaphoceras briacensis	100.91	dashed	DASHED.  Full name = Arrhaphoceras (Praeschloenbachia) briacensis.  "introduced by Scholz (1973) for an uppermost Albian interval in which Mortoniceras and Ostlingoceras (O.) puzosianum were absent, and Hyphoplites had appeared." (Kennedy, in Gale et al., 2011, Cret. Res.).  Spans Albian/Cenomanian boundary.  Projected as 1 cycle (405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian  at Col de Palluel by Gale et al., 2011.
	Mortoniceras perinflatum	101.41		Full name = Mortoniceras (Subschloenbachia) perinflatum.  Begins at FAD of index species; which is projected as 2 1/4 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011)
	Mortoniceras rostratum	101.72		Full name = Mortoniceras (Subschloenbachia) rostratum.  Short zone defined by FAD of index species, which begins 3 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011); or just above base of P. buxtorfi foram zone.  GTS04:  Base of S. dispar correlated to base of R. appenninica foraminifer Zone (cycle-scaled as 100.9 Ma)
	Mortoniceras fallax	103.13		Base (poorly delimited) is about 6 1/2 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Col de Palluel, and coincides with FAD of Turriseffeli nannofossil   (Gale et al., 2011).  
	Mortoniceras inflatum	103.94	dashed	DASH (see last note):  Base is FAD of index species = 8 1/2 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Col de Palluel, and is at base of T. ticinensis Foram zone  (Gale et al., 2011).  BUT, there may be a hiatus in their section at this point !
	Mortoniceras pricei	106.98		Base is FAD of index species above LAD of D.cristatum (underlying zone index).  Base is 16 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011).  
	Diploceras cristatum	107.59		FAD of D. cristatum defines base of Upper Albian; and "traditionally" was a subzone in an expanded M. inflatum, but raised to Zone status (e.g., review by Kennedy in Gale et al., 2011).  Base is 178 1/2 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian at Coll de Palluel, and is just above base of T. praeticinensis Foram zone  (Gale et al., 2011).  In GTS04, the base of extended M. inflatum (with D. cristatum as subzone) was assigned as FAD of foraminifer B. breggiensis (base of T. praeticinensis Subzone in Leckie et al., 2002) => essentially same level.
	Euhoplites lautus	108.25	dashed	Base of lautus/nitidus:  No direct assignment to Foram Zones.  Equal-subzones in Middle Albian of Boreal zones used for scaling.
	Euhoplites loricatus	109.56	dashed	Base of loricatus/intermedius:  No direct assignment to Foram Zones.  Equal-subzones in Middle Albian of Boreal zones used for scaling.
	Hoplites dentatus	110.22	dashed	DASH -- Base of Upper Albian = Base of dentatus/lyelli Zone/Subzone (full Zone name = Hoplites (Hoplites) dentatus):  No direct assignment to Foram Zones; but Gale et al. (2011) assign DASHED at 25 1/4 cycles (of 405 kyr) below base-Cenomanian; but with base-tardefurcata set by them at base-Pacquier level at 26.6 cycles, this seems rather tight => DASHED at 24 cycles up.  Hardenbol et al. (1998) had dashed the FAD of nannofossil A. albianus at a level just below its base.  Here, for lack of any definite calibration, I've scaled duration according to its 2 Subzones.
	Douvilleiceras mammillatum	110.87	dashed	DASHED -- Base of mammillatum/perinflata:  There is a problem; summarized in Reboulet et al. (2011; Kilian Group report) -- has problems of correlation to Tethys.  Herrle and Mutterlose (2003) composite section DASHED at 15 m above Paquier, compared to 90 m between Kilian and Paquier => considering there are 4.6 cycles of 0.405 myr between those levels, then base-mammillatum is approximately 1 cycle (0.405 myr) above base-tardefurcata (used here).
	Leymeriella tardefurcata	111.27		Tethyan version (but not Boreal) correlates with Base of Paquier organic-rich layer; which is 26.6 cycles below base-Cenomanian (Huang et al., 2010; Gale et al., 2011)
	Hypacanthoplites jacobi	115.64	dashed	DASH -- Base of H. jacobi is DASHED as 1/2 up in T. bejaouensis Foram zone (on composite meters) by Herle et al. (2004) in SE France composite.  It is a LONG zone in SE France sections; indeed, spans Jacob and Kilian organic-rich layers, and ends at base of Pacquier layer.
	Acanthohoplites nolani	116.83	dashed	DASH -- Zone is also called "Nolaniceras nolani".  Base of Nolani (hence, top of P. nutfieldiensis zone) is DASHED as 1/4th up in T. bejaouensis Foram zone (on composite meters) by Herle et al. (2004) in SE France composite.  GTS04 =  set at 115 Ma to fit the constraint of an Ar-Ar age of 114 ﾱ1.3 Ma within that underlying zone.  This also fits its calibration to foraminifer datums (Belliers et al., 2000) on chart of Leckie et al. (2002; after scaling to 125 Ma at base-Aptian)
	Parahoplites melchioris	118.02		Base of P. melchioris or "Parahoplites nutfieldiensis" ammonite zone is at BASE of T. bejaouaensis Foram zone in SE France (summarized in Herle et al., 2004); and that Foram zone is cycle-scaled (Huang et al., 2010) = assumed tie for GTS2012.  GTS04 = Duration of P. melchions and E. subnodosocostatum set equal for estimating base-P. melchions age.
	Epicheloniceras martinoides	122.98		Base of E.martinoides ammonite zone (full name = Cheloniceras (Epicheloniceras) martinoides;  called Epicheloniceras subnodosocostatum on SEPM chart) is at BASE of G.ferreolensis Foram zone in SE France (summarized in Herle et al., 2004); and that Foram zone is cycle-scaled (Huang et al., 2010) = assumed tie for GTS2012.  Equivalent to Cheloniceras (Epicheloniceras) martinoides zone.  GTS04 = Top of foraminifer L. cabri (120.7 Ma in rescaling of Leckie et al., 2002) is just above the top of the D. furcata ammonite zone at Le Bedoule (Moullade et al., 1998); therefore the zonal boundary age was rounded to 121 Ma.  Zone is approximately equivalent to boreal Cheloniceras (Epicheloniceras) martinoides zone
	Dufrenoyia furcata	123.88		Base of D. furcata zone = base of nannofossil E. floralis in SE France (Moullade et al., 1998), which, in turn, is estimated (after rescaling to our base-Aptian) at 121.9 Ma in the chart in Leckie et al., 2002 .  Zone is set equivalent to Tropaeum (Tropaeum) bowerbanki in this chart.
	Deshayesites deshayesi	125.71		Base of D.deshayesi = FAD of foraminifer R. angustus in SE France; so used cycle-placement of this event.  D. deshayesi to D. oglanlensis (3 zones) assigned equal duration
	Deshayesites forbesi	126.01		Also called Deshayesites weissi in some zonations.  DASH -- midway between base of D. deshayesi and D. oglaniensis Zone  A "unnamed" subzone was added to the base when an "upper" subzone was created (Kilian group, 2011).
	Deshayesites oglanlensis	126.3		Base of Aptian is defined as base of polarity Chron M0r; and the base of D. oglaniensis is assumed to be close to this level.  A "unnamed" subzone was added to the base when an upper subzone was created (Kilian group, 2011).  D. tuarkyricus zone is used as basal Aptian in some charts; but the D. tuarkyricus index species is only found in Turkmenistan;  therefore, IUGS Lower Cretaceous group proposes D. oglanlensis.  Zone is set equivalent to Prodeshayesites fissicostatus of Boreal in this chart
	Imerites giraudi	127.47	dashed	DASH -- Barremian tethyan ammonite zone 'I. giraudi' replaces 'Heroceras astieri' in some other zonal scales.  Was a brief Zone (in GTS08); but that former range was demoted to a Subzone (Killian group; 2009/2011); and the zone name extended upward to encompass the previous two "overlying zones" as subzones.
	Gerhardtia sartousi	128.63	dashed	DASH -- Barremian tethyan ammonite zone 'H. sartousi' (or 'sartousiana') is a subzone of the 'H. feraudianus' zone in some other zonal scales.  The upper half is equivalent to 'limentinus' s.z.
	Ancyloceras vandenheckii	129.41		approximately Chron M3r.8 in Italy (Bartolocci et al., 1992; Channell et al., 1995).  Barremian tethyan ammonite zone 'A. vandenheckii' has replaced the lower portion of the 'Emiriceras' barremense' of other zonal scales.  OTHER NOTE: 'E.barremense' zone is equivalent to upper-half of A.vandenheckii + lower-half of H.sartousi
	Moutoniceras moutonianum	129.6	dashed	Was named "Coronites darsi" in GTS08, which is now used the basal horizon in this new zone.  Zones of Lower Barremian were extensively revised (Kilian Group, 2002).  In particular, the former "H. caillaudianus" was subdivided into 3 zones.  Upper 3 zones of Early Barremian given equal durations.
	Kotetishvilia compressissima	129.78	dashed	Former base of Holcodiscus caillaudianus Zone.  Zones of Lower Barremian were extensively revised (Kilian Group, 2002).  In particular, the former "H. caillaudianus" was subdivided into 3 zones.  Formerly "Pulchellia" compressissima.  Barremian tethyan ammonite zones of 'Holcodiscus caillaudianus' (formerly spelled 'H. callaudi') and 'N. nicklesi' were incorporated as subzones in a single zone 'Pulchellia compressissima' in earlier time scales.  To add to confusion, the 'H. caillaudianus' may be subdivided into an upper 'moutoniceras' and a lower 'compressissima' s.z.  Upper 3 zones of Early Barremian given equal durations.
	Nicklesia pulchella 	129.97		N. pulchella was elevated to Zone status by Killian Group (2002); was formerly a horizon.  Upper 3 zones of Early Barremian given equal durations.
	Nicklesia nicklesi	130.37		Cycle-stratigrahy (Bodin et al., 2006) suggests a duration of about 0.4 myr.  Barremian Tethyan ammonite zone N. nicklesi had incorporated a former separate zone 'Niclesia pulchella' of SE France as its upper horizon (Hoedemaeker et al., 1993).  This former zone only occupied a few beds in the Angles section, and could not be recognized without the index species.  This 'N. pulchella' s.z. (or horizon) was arbitrarily scaled as half of the N. nicklesi zone in the "Hardenbol" scale.
	Taveraidiscus hugii	130.77		Chron M5n.8.  Full name = Taveraidiscus hugii auctorum.  Formerly called Spitidiscus hugii.  Cycle-stratigrahy (Bodin et al., 2006) suggests a duration of about 0.4 myr.  New subzone at base (Killian group, 2009).
	Pseudothurmannia ohmi	131.57		Cycle-stratigrahy (Bodin et al., 2006) suggests a duration of about 0.8 myr.  GTS07 -- P. ohmi duration is only 5% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07, but partial gap in their data).  Implies extremely brief subzones (horizons).  Formerly called Pseudothurmannia angulicostata auctorum.  Three subzones (from base) are P. ohmi, Pseudothurmannia catulloi, Pseudothurmannia picteti -- Kilian Group, 2002.  [DTS NOTE:  Hauterivian uppermost ammonite zone in tethyan realm 'Pseudothurmannia angulicostata auct.' has two subzones:  lower = P. angulicostata auct.;  upper = Pseudothurmannia catulloi (provisional name) (Hoedemaeker et al., 1993).  Hoedemaeker would prefer that these were given zonal rank, because the ammonite assemblages are greatly different (and, may be a better definition of the base of the Barremian); but the rest of the working group preferred two subzones.  OTHER NOTE: Contains 2 subzones.]
	Balearites balearis	132.37		Cycle-stratigrahy (Bodin et al., 2006) suggests a duration of about 0.8 myr.  GTS07 -- P. balearis duration is only 6% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Very brief; but subdivided into 4 subzones !! (maybe these should be just horizons?).  Genus was formerly Pseudothurmannia.  Used version by Reboullet in McArthur et al (2007)
	Pleisiospitidiscus ligatus	132.68		Duration = 21% of pre-Balearis Hauterivian (McArthur et al., 2007). GTS07 -- P. ligatus duration is 19% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Hauterivian tethyan ammonite zone "Plesiospitidiscus ligatus" is sometimes in quotes, because the index species is not a true 'P.ligatus', but 'sed subseq. litt.'.  This zone still awaits redefinition (Hoedemaeker et al., 1993).
	Subsaynella sayni	133.09		Duration = 27% of pre-Balearis Hauterivian (McArthur et al., 2007). GTS07 -- S. sayni duration is 24% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  In some schemes; Hauterivian Tethyan ammonite zone 'S. sayni' has a 'cruasense' s.z. (or horizon) in its lower portion.
	Lyticoceras nodosoplicatus	133.35		Duration = 17% of pre-Balearis Hauterivian (McArthur et al., 2007). GTS07 -- L. nodosoplicatus duration is 15% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  In some schemes, Hauterivian Tethyan ammonite zone 'L. nodosoplicatum' has a 'variegatus' subzone (or horizon) in its lower part.
	Crioceratites loryi	133.59		Duration = 16% of pre-Balearis Hauterivian (McArthur et al., 2007). GTS07 -- C. loryi duration is 14% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Subzones scaled equally in McArthur'07.  Hauterivian tethyan ammonite zone 'C. loryi' has two horizons (set as subzones in some papers and used as such here for scaling):  lower = Crioceratites loryi;  upper = Olcostephanus (Jeannoticeras) jeannoti.  However the ranges of these two species is not precisely known (Hoedemaeker et al., 1993).
	Acanthodiscus radiatus	133.88		Base M10n  (GTS04 was Base Chron M11n).  Duration = 19% of pre-Balearis Hauterivian (McArthur et al., 2007).  GTS07 -- A. radiatus duration is 17% of duration of Hauterivian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Hauterivian Tethyan ammonite zone 'A. radiatus' was subdivided in some schemes into an upper 'buxtorfi' s.z., and a lower 'castellanensis' s.z.; but not accepted by Killian group.  [And not used in GTS2004 for scaling.]
	Criosarasinella furcillata	134.98		GTS07 -- C. furcillata duration is 20% of duration of Valanginian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Subzone durations are approximately 2:3 callidiscus:furcillata in their scale.  Former "Neocomites (Teschenites) pachydicranus" zone has been completely replaced in new zonal scheme by Kilian Group (2002).  New upper zone has 2 subzones (Teschenites callidiscus, and C. furcillata)
	Neocomites peregrinus	135.81		GTS07 -- N. peregrinus duration is 15% of duration of Valanginian (McArthur et al, PPP07). N. peregrinus zone has 2 subzones (Neocomites peregrinus, formerly in S. verrucosum; and Olcostephanus (O.) nicklesi);  the former Himantoceras trinodosum subzone has been replaced   Subzone durations are equal in their scale.
	Saynoceras verrucosum	136.41		GTS07 -- S. verrucosum duration is only 11% of duration of Valanginian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  S. verrucosum Zone now has 2 subzones (S. verrucosum and Karakaschiceras pronecostatum) -- ("Kilian group", 2002)   Subzone durations are equal in their scale.  [Previous DTS Note on S. verrucosum:  Valanginian tethyan ammonite zone 'S. verrucosum' has three horizons in SE France and SE Spain (Bulot, Thieuloy & Company; reported in Hoedemaeker et al., 1993); but these are not yet formalized:  lower = S.verrucosum; middle = Karadaschiceras pronocostatum; upper = Varlheideites peregrinus.  OTHER NOTE: S. verrucosum Zone has 3 horizons in France & Spain; but these are not yet formalized.]
	Busnardoites campylotoxus	137.68		GTS07 -- B. campylotoxus duration is 23% of duration of Valanginian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  Subzone durations are approximately 2:1 for biassalense to campylotixus in their scale.  Name "Thurmanniceras" campylotoxus has also been used for this ammonite.  Divided by Killian Group (2002) into 2 subzones, with the upper one having two horizons
	Tirnovella pertransiens	139.39		Base = polarity Chron M14r.3.  GTS07 -- T. pertransiens duration is 31% of duration of Valanginian (McArthur et al, PPP07).  In GTS04, it was a single 'subzone" for scaling.  Name "Thurmanniceras" pertransiens has also been used for this ammonite.
	Subthurmannia boissieri	141.93		Base = Chron M16r.5.  "Fauriella" and "Berriasella" have also been used as genera names for this species "boissieri".  The name "Berriasella" paraminounum has also been used for the subzone index ammonite.
	Subthurmannia occitanica	143.57		Base = Chron M17r.3.  "Neocomites" subalpina and "Tirnovella" subalpina have also been used for this ammonite.  Calibration to magnetic polarity chrons is constrained to upper half of M17r in Berrias section.
	Berriasella jacobi	145.95		Dash at about M19n.2n.3; due to probable distortions in sedimentation in the compact reference sections -- At Puerto Escano (Pruner et al., 2010), base is about M19n.2n.1.  At Sierra Gorda (Ogg et al., 1984), Zone base is M19n.2n.55 (+/-.05).  Base-Tithonian, if use base-M18r, is WITHIN it.  The B.jacobi subzone was placed in the Tithonian in some earlier time scales.  The current trend is to put it into the Berriasian.   BUT, Killian Group (2005; 2009) recommended abandoning subzones of B.jacobi Zone (which would be undivided); partly due to difficulty in separating the "historic" subzones.  Therefore, these subzone (B.jacobi and overlying P.grandis s.z.) have been recommended to be combined in a single undivided B.jacobi Zone, because the P.grandis s.z. "can be considered an impoverished 'jacobi' association" (Hoedemaeker et al., 1993).   The age of the top of B.jacobi zone has uncertain calibration to the magnetic polarity time scale, but appears to be constrained to be within the lower part of Chron M18r.  The "Mesozoic-Cenozoic Chronostratigraphy" chart of Hardenbol et al. (in prep., SEPM Spec. Publ.) gives the 'jacobi' and 'grandis' subzones equal duration, but this would imply a top of 'jacobi' that is in the middle of M18n, which is much too young.  Therefore, pending improved magnetostratigraphy, I have retained the Chron M18r.0 age in the DTS.  ORIGINAL COMMENT: May be as high as Chron M18r.2.  See NOTE.
	Durangites	146.61		Placed at M20n.1n.8:  At Puerto Escano (Pruner et al., 2010), is about M20n.1n.65.  Higher at Sierra Gorda (Ogg et al., 1984) at M19r.1 (+/-.2); which is only about 0.1 myr higher.  Uncertainty in magnetostratigraphic correlation to base of Tithonian Durangites zone is ﾱ.2 of polarity chron M19r = approx. 0.08 m.y.
	Micracanthoceras microcanthum	147.72		base M20n (+/-.1) at both Sierra Gorda (Ogg et al., 1984) and Puerto Escano (Pruner et al., 2010).  The zones of P. transitorius and "Simplisphinctes" are combined into a Microcanthum Zone in some schemes (used here; following digarm from F. Oloriz); but separated as zones in the main reference section.  Base Calpionellid Zone A1 is just above base of Microcanthum Zone.
	Micracanthoceras ponti / Burckhardticeras peroni	148.08		M20r.5 (+/-.1)
	Semiformiceras fallauxi	149.87		M22n.95 (+/-.05)
	Semiformiceras semiforme	150.41		M22n.6 (+/-.1);  Semiformiceras semiforme (=zone of Haploceras (Volanites) verruciferum)
	Semiformiceras darwini	150.94		M22n.25 (+/-.05); Semiformiceras darwini (=zone of Virgatosimoceras albertinum);  subzones arbitrarily given equal durations
	Hybonoticeras hybonotum	152.06		base M22An (+/-.1)  [DTS95 had as next higher subchron]
	Hybonoticeras beckeri	153.55		M23r.2r.1 (+/-.05)  [DTS95 had slightly higher, as next higher R subzone, M23r.1r.1]  Subzones given equal duration.
	Aulacostephanus eudoxus	153.96		Full name = Aulacostephanus (Pseudomutabilis) eudoxus.  Base = M24r.1r.8 (+/-.1)
	Aspidoceras acanthicum	154.47		Base = M24r.2r.6 (+/-.1)
	Crussoliceras divisum	154.84		Assigned as M24Ar.6 (+/-.1) . Subzones given equal duration.  Called "tenuicostatum" on SEPM chart; but French ammonite book scheme used here.
	Ataxioceras hypselocyclum	155.6		Full name of Zone = Ataxioceras (A.) hypselocyclum.  Assigned as M25n.8 (+/-.1)
	Sutneria platynota	156.02		M25r.1 (+/-.1).  Cycles => 0.40 myr.   French sections (e.g., Crussol) indicate a 1:2:3 relative duration of the subzones.
	Idoceras planula	156.75		Base = base M26n.1r. = Assigned age.  Duration from Cycles (Strasser, 2007) was 0.3 to 0.4 myr (assigned 0.35 here), but may be missing 0.4 myr "missed beat"? => 0.755 total used  Using cycles in upper Galar subzone (.21), then 0.55 myr for Planula Subzone is extrapolated from Chateauneuf d"Oze   Crussol (combining Planula-Proteron local subzones).  N-interval considered uncertain; but R-zone below may be reliable.
	Epipeltoceras bimammatum	158.54		Full name of subzone = Aspidoceras (Euaspidoceras) hypselum.  Base = M28Ar.25.  Span of full Bimammatum -- Strasser (2007) had as 1.2 myr; but we assumed a missing 0.4 myr "missed beat"; plus another 0.1 myr, for entire Bimammatum scaling.  Both subzones are a merged E. hypselum subzone in Aguilon => scaling done for both together.  Assigned as lower 55% of Bimammatum Zone based on magstrat.
	Perisphinctes bifurcatus	159.44		Full name of Zone = Perisphinctes (Dichotomoceras) bifurcatus.  Full name of subzone = Perisphinctes (Dichotomoceras) stenocycloides.Base = M29r.5 (approx. due to poor data here).  Only 1.5 cycles of 100kyr known in lower part of Zone (but subzone limit uncertain).  Base is hiatus in Aguilon (At Aguilon, the Stenocycloides Subzone is only about 15% of the Bifurcatus Zone).  A total duration for Bifucatus of 0.9 myr is used here, based partly on apparent scaling relative to M-sequence; of which lower 40% is assigned to this subzone.
	Gregoryceras transversarium	160.09		Base - base M30An approx.  Cycle-duration = 0.65 (Boulila et al., 2010).  With Parandieri as lower 40% (cycle section estimate); then Aguilon relative thicknesses imply Rotoides= 8%,  Schilli = 20%, and Luciaeformis = 30%.  10:30:20:40 proportions used here.  Parandieri (?0.25 from cycle scaling)
	Perisphinctes plicatilis	160.84		Full name = Perisphinctes (Arisphinctes) plicatilis.  Ful subzone name = Cardioceras (Vertebriceras) vertebrale.  Approx. base M32r on short-wavelength DeepTow = average of Spain and Dorset
	Cardioceras cordatum	161.39		Full name = Cardioceras (C.) cordatum.  Base = M33Bn.5 approx.  Subzone duration -- .05 known; and 0.1 (entire no-biostrat below) added
	Quenstedtoceras mariae	163.47		Base of Oxfordian is assigned here as M37n.1n.25.  Full name = Quenstedtoceras (Q.) mariae.  Cycle for C. scarburgense = C1 (less 50kyr at base' assuming Th = Redcliff)-C2, and 1/2 of C3.
	Quenstedtoceras lamberti	163.81		Full name of Zone = Quenstedtoceras (Lamberticeras) lamberti.  Full name of Subzone = Orionoides (Poculisphinctes) poculum.  Base had been M37n.2n.3 (+/-.2); but is in R-zone in England.  Cycle-strat (Huret et al.) implies Lamberti is about 0.76, with a very short Athleta (0.1); but I think it makes Athleta seem too brief.
	Peltocoeras athleta	163.97		Full name of subzone = Hecticoceras (Orbignyiceras) trezeense.  BASE from Mid-Depth deep-tow = within lower M38n.1n.  Cyclestrat implies very brief zone (0.1 myr in Huret et al.,'06)
	Erymnoceras coronatum	164.5		Mid-Depth deep-tow = M38n.4n.7.
	Reineckeia anceps	164.63		Mid-Depth deep-tow = M38n.4n.1.  Implied short-duration fits cycles (0.2 myr) of Huret et al.'06
	Macrocephalites gracilis	165.59		Full Zone name = Macrocephalites (Dolikephalites) gracilis.  Full Subzone name = Bullatimorphites (Bomburites) prahecquense.  Base from Mid-Depth deep-tow suggests M39n.2n.6
	Bullatimorphites bullatus	166.07		Full name = Bullatimorphites (Kheraiceras) bullatus.  Mid-Depth deep-tow = base M39.3n (assumed small-N at Albstadt is this level)
	Clydoniceras discus	166.24	dashed	Full Zone name = Clydoniceras (C.) discus  [Late-Middle Bathonian ammonite subzones (or 1.5 s.z. if single-subzone Zone = total of 10) given equal duration from base-subcontractus to base-Callovian.]

	Morrisiceras morrisi	166.78	dashed	Full Zone name = Morrisiceras (M.) morrisi.  M. morrisi zone given a single-zone (1.5 s.z.) duration.  [Late-Middle Bathonian ammonite subzones (or 1.5 s.z. if single-subzone Zone = total of 10) given equal duration from base-subcontractus to base-Callovian.]
	Tulites subcontractus	166.91		Full name = Tulites (T.) subcontractus.  Base placed as M40n.2n.8 to equate "Subc-R" with M40n.1r.  Zone given 1.5 s.z. duration.  [Late-Middle Bathonian ammonite subzones (or 1.5 s.z. if single-subzone Zone = total of 10) given equal duration from base-subcontractus to base-Callovian.]
	Procerites progracilis	167.37	dashed	Full Zone name = Procerites (P.)  progracilis.  Full subzone name = Cadomites (C.) orbignyi.  [Early Bathonian ammonite subzones (total of 6) given equal duration from base-subcontractus to base-Bathonian]
	Procerites aurigerus	167.82	dashed	Full name = Procerites (Siemiradzkia) aurigerus.  Maybe base of M41n.3n; but magnetostrat had grouped Zigzag and Aurigenus => subzone scaling was done.  [Early Bathonian ammonite subzones (total of 6) given equal duration from base-subcontractus to base-Bathonian]
	Zigzagiceras zigzag 	168.28		Full name = Zigzagiceras (Z.) zigzag.  Assigned as Base M42n.1n in Mid-depth deep-tow.
	Parkinsonia parkinsoni	168.69	dashed	Full name = Parkinsonia (P.) parkinsoni.  Late Bajocian ammonite subzones (6 of them in Parkisoni-Garantiana) are given equal duration.
	Garantiana garantiana	169.11		Full Zone name = Garantiana (G.) garantiana.  Full subzone name = Garantiana (Pseudogarantiana) dichotoma.  Assigned as Base M42n.4n

	Witchellia laeviuscula	170.13	dashed	Full subzone name = Euhoploceras (Fissilobiceras) ovalis.  Early-Middle Bajocian ammonite subzones (14 of them) are given equal duration.  
	Hyperlioceras discites	170.3		Full Zone name = Hyperlioceras (H.) discites.  Full subzone name = Hyperlioceras (Toxolioceras) walkeri .  Assigned as M44n.1r.8 of Mid-depth deep-tow (uppermost-Aalen long R set as this polarity zone, and onset of longer-N of Disc-N2 assumed t be M44n.1n)
	Graphoceras concavum	170.83		Duration was 0.43 from Huret et al., 2008; but shifted 0.1 myr from underlying zone to partly adjust Magnetics (which, also, might have uncertainties) to fit Deep-Tow M44n.1r base.
	Brasilia bradfordensis	171.29		Duration from Huret et al., 2008.  Genus is "Ludwigia" in some schemes.  Ludwigia murchisonae zone of S.Switzerland also includes bradfordensis zone.     [This follows Arkell's usage]
	Ludwigia murchisonae	172.13		Duration from Huret et al., 2008
	Leioceras opalinum	174.15		Duration from Huret et al., 2008
	Pleydellia aalensis	174.43		Chunju Huang (pers. commun., 10 Jan 2010) restudy of Huret et al. (2008).  Huret'08 had slightly shorter durations.  However, for P.aalenis and D. pseudoradiosa; an adjustment of 0.15 was made (shifted from Pseudorad to Aalensis).  Dash base.
	Dumortieria pseudoradiosa	174.71	dashed	Dash base.  Cycle-strat duration (Huret et al., 2008; as revised by Chunju Huang)
	Phlyseogrammoceras dispansum	174.97	dashed	Dash base.  Cycle-strat duration (Huret et al., 2008; as revised by Chunju Huang)
	Grammoceras thouarsense	176.23		0
	Haugia variabilis	178.24		Cycle-strat duration (Huret et al., 2008; as revised by Chunju Huang).  Hoewver, this led to a pronounced distortion in Sr-isotope trend; therefore a portion is shifted to the following G. thouarsense zone.
	Hildoceras bifrons	180.36		Cycle-strat duration (Huret et al., 2008; as revised by Chunju Huang)
	Harpoceras serpentinum	181.7		Onset of main OAE = base of H. serpentinum (see Hesselbo et al., 2007 about problems with inter-regional correlation; but this is their preferred assignment) = assigned (controls entire Hett-Pliens ages below, and Toarc to basal-Oxf ages above).   Basal zone also called Levisoni subzone.
	Dactylioceras tenuicostatum	182.7		Full name = Dactylioceras (Orthodactylites) tenuicostatum.  FIXED as 182.7 Ma = Karoo lavas [same dates using mean ArAr converted (Jourdan et al., 2007) with ﾱ0.7 and UPb (EGU abstract by Moulin et al., 2010) with ﾱ0.4)] assumption that this is onset of LOWER C13 excursion (fits R-polarity); but shifted to 182.5 to better fit UPb on OAE.  Relative duration of zone was 0.3 myr from Linear Sr isotope trend; but Os-isotopes (Cohen-Coe et al.) and Cycles (Suan et al., 2008, has ca. 0.8; and Huang, 2010, pers. comm. has 1.0) suggest it is much longer.  Used Suan's .8 myr (which is published), plus 0.2 for condensed boundary (Bodin et al'11).  Subzones scaled according to equivalences to Boreal equal-subzone divisions. 
	Emaciaticeras emaciatum	183.49		considered equivalent to upper 1/3rd of P. apyrenum s.z.
	Arieticeras algovianum	185.31		considered equivalent to lower 2/3rds of A. gibbosus s.z.  Base calibrated as top of A. gibbosus subzone
	Fuciniceras lavinianum	187.56		Relatively long duration, due to implied Sr-scaling having expanded the A. margaritatus in England
	Prodactylioceras davoei	188.54		0
	Tragophylloceras ibex	189.35		Ibex zone in Tethyan realm doesn't extend as old as Boreal Ibex, according to SEPM chart.
	Uptonia jamesoni	190.82		0
	Echioceras raricostatum	192.81
	Oxynoticeras oxynotum	193.81	dashed	Sinemurian ammonite subzones (17 of them) are given equal duration.
	Asteroceras obtusum	195.31	dashed	Sinemurian ammonite subzones (17 of them) are given equal duration.
	Caenisites turneri	196.31	dashed	Uppermost zone of Early Sinemurian is Caenisites turneri.
	Arnioceras semicostatum	197.8	dashed	Full subzone name = Coroniceras (Paracoroniceras) charlesi.  Lowest subzone of A. semicostatum Zone (Sinemurian) is "Coroniceras reynesi s.z." or "Coroniceras lyra" in some Boreal ammonite scales.
	Arietites bucklandi	199.3		0
	Schlotheimia angulata	200.1		Cycles from England (Rohl et al., 2010)
	Alsatites liasicus	200.85		Cycles from England (Rohl et al., 2010)
	Psiloceras planorbis	201.1		Traditional" base-Jurassic in British stratigraphy.  Assigned as an arbitrary 0.1 myr above base of P. pacificum (hence 0.2 above base of P. tilmanni), based on Kozur's and Lucas's schematic diagrams of Tri-Jur boundary events.  Zone duration from Cycles from England (Rohl et al., 2010).  Subzones assigned as equal-durations.
	Psiloceras spelae	201.3		Basal "new" zone (may be called "Psiloceras tilmanni") not present in traditional England, and need to place base-Jur via C-13 to GSSP  (Rohl's paper is a bit confused here); Debated duration (see GSSP proposal -- which suggests more on unpublished Irish cycles; and heated debate at Jur. Congress in Aug'2010)
	TOP	201.5	dashed	Assigned as arbitrary 0.1 myr below top of C. crickmayi (N.Amer.) following schematic of Kozur, and Fig. 4 of Guex et al (EPSL, 2004).
	Choristoceras marshi	202.16		30% in E23n.  Subzones of larger C. marshi zone are assigned as separate Zones in some schemes.  Kozur (2003; Table 3; and in Bachmann-Kozur '04)  had Chor. marshi divided into an upper Chor. marshi subzone and a lower Chor. ammonitiforme subzone; but didn't use in Table sent to Jim Ogg in 2006 => omitted here.
	Choristoceras" haueri 	204.26		90% up in Kozur's M. hern-M.posthern Zone.  Was about 60% up in Kozur's M. hern-M.posthern Zone => 60% between C.suessi and V.stuerz.  Kozur (2006, wiritten to Jim Ogg): "Choristoceras"  haueri Zone is junior synonym of the latter: Vandites stuerzenbaumi Zone."  However, his scheme (2003; and 2006 sent to Jim Ogg) has an upper substage of Vandites stuerzenbaumi.
	Cochloceras suessi	209.46		Derived from FAD of M.posthern (lowest E17r).  Onset of Cochloceras genus is coincident with FAD of conodont M. posthernsteini (option 1 for base of Rhaetian, used here).
	Metasibirites spinescens	211.45	dashed	DASHED.  30% up in E16n.  Former Sagenites reticulatus; but revised with Rhaetian GSSP "cutting former zone" by Krystyn (as relayed to me by Krystyn).  Begins in latest late Norian = relatively brief).  Krystyn version would continue into Rhaetian (instead of a Cochloceras suessi zone).  Formerly considered completely Norian (2nd zone of Sevatian).  However, zonal/subzonal division Sagenites quinquepunctatus through Rhaetian interval varies among authors (e.g., SEPM/GTS04 vers Kozur'03).
	Sagenites quinquepunctatus	213.97		60% up in E14r.  Was a subzone of large R. suessi Zone, but following Kozur here as a separate Zone, which would make sense if the base of S. reticulatus becomes base of Rhaetian Stage.
	Halorites macer	215.23		70% up in E14n.  Kozur (2003, and written to Jim Ogg, 2006) puts this ammonite zone into Sevatian, rather than Alaunian; and correlates with base of M. bidentata conodont zone (his expanded veersion of that zone).  GTS2004 has this zone with 2 subzones (lower Amarassites semiplicatus, upper "un-named"; but these are not indicated in Kozur's diagrams => omitted here => relative age-span is different.
	Mesohimavatites columbianus	216.9		base E13r.  Zone was called Himavites hogarti in GTS2004 (using SEPM), but Kozur (2003, Bachmann-Kozur, 2004) call this as Mesohimavatites columbianus (projecting British Columbia?); with no indicated subzones.  But, McRoberts'10 (bivalve chart) has Hima. hogarti and an underlying Hima. watsoni.  Confusing.  Was base Chron E17r.  
	Cyrtopleurites bicrenatus	217.42		65% up in combined Chron E13n
	Juvavites magnus	218.16		15% up in combined Chron E13n
	Malayites paulckei	224.53		95% up in Chron E8r.  Subzones of Malayites (based on Krystyn et al., 2002, EPSL 203:343-351, Fig. 1) are given equal duration
	Guembelites jandianus 	228.35		Base E7n (base of N at GSSP).  Kozur uses S. kerri (N.Amer.) for this "standard zone".
	Anatropites spinosus	231.08		Base of E4n.  Kozur's "standard" uses N.Amer. K. macrolobatus and T. welleri for middle-upper Tuvalian.
	Tropites subbullatus	232.69	dashed	DASHED -- Uncertain (no magnetostratigraphy); therefore proportioned from equal subzones (two subzonal units in relative duration).  Kozur's "standard" uses N.Amer. K. macrolobatus and T. welleri for middle-upper Tuvalian.
	Tropites dilleri	233.5	dashed	DASHED -- uncertain (no magnetostratigraphy).  No subzonal divisions => scaled as "1.5 subzonal units" in relative duration.
	Austrotrachyceras austriacum	234.58	dashed	DASHED -- uncertain (no magnetostratigraphy).  Two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Trachyceras aonoides	235.39	dashed	DASHED -- uncertain (no magnetostratigraphy).  No subzonal divisions => scaled as "1.5 subzonal units" in relative duration.  T. aonoides and T. aon are combined into a general Trachyceras zone in some zonal schemes.
	Trachyceras aon	236.19	dashed	DASHED -- uncertain (no magnetostratigraphy).  No subzonal divisions => scaled as "1.5 subzonal units" in relative duration.  T. aonoides and T. aon are combined into a general Trachyceras zone in some zonal schemes.
	Daxatina canadensis	237		Main marker for Carnian GSSP.  Fixed at 237 Ma.  No subzonal divisions => scaled as "1.5 subzonal units" in relative duration.  
	Frankites regoledanus	237.9	dashed	DASHED --   No subzonal divisions => scaled as "1.5 subzonal units" in relative duration.
	Protrachyceras neumayri	238.5	dashed	DASHED -- span of one subzonal unit.  Zone-status in Balini 2010 (used here).  Kozur'03 shows an undivided "Protrachy. archelaus" zone instead of dual P.neumayri - P.longobardicum subzones.
	Protrachyceras longobardicum	239.1	dashed	DASHED -- span of one subzonal unit.  Zone-status in Balini 2010 (used here).  Kozur'03 shows an undivided "Protrachy. archelaus" zone instead of dual P.neumayri - P.longobardicum subzones.
	Eotrachyceras" gredleri	239.7	dashed	DASHED -- span of one subzonal unit in relative duration.  Zone is not used on some charts; but is on Balini'10 and McRoberts'10.
	Protrachyceras margitosum	240.3	dashed	DASHED -- span of one subzonal unit in relative duration.  Zone is merged with P. gredleri for a united "P. gredleri" on some charts; but is on Balini'10 and McRoberts'10.
	Eoprotrachyceras curionii	241.5		GTS04 -- Radiometric age pf 241.5 (ﾱ1.5 myr) = control on scaling of Anisian-Ladinian.  E. curiionii spans two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Nevadites secedensis	242.1		Radiometric age of 242 (ﾱ1 myr).  Nevadites Zone called Nevadites secedensis Zne by some authors, after the FAD of the first species of this genus.  Bachmann-Kozur (2004) didn't apply any subzones.
	Reitziites reitzi	242.57	dashed	DASH -- Zone is called "Hungarites" Zone by some authors.  Two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Kellnerites felsoeoersensis	243.05	dashed	DASHED -- Two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Paraceratites trinodosus	243.99	dashed	DASHED -- Four subzonal units in relative duration.  Zone has alternative zone/subzone divisions (e.g., Table 2 in Kozur'03; and I've used Bachmann-Kozur'04 here => middle subzone is "two" subzonal units).
	Schreyerites binodosus	244.47	dashed	DASHED -- Two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Balatonites balatonicus	244.94	dashed	DASHED -- Two subzonal units in relative duration.
	Acrocordiceras ismidicus	245.3	dashed	DASHED -- 1.5 subzonal units in relative duration (no subzone divisions).  Was called "Aghdarbandites" ismidicus in Kozur'03; but McRoberts uses "Acrochodiceras" in table (same genera as coeval British Columbia zone)
	Nicomedites osmani	245.65	dashed	DASHED -- 1.5 subzonal units in relative duration (no subzone divisions)
	Lenotropites caurus	246.01	dashed	DASHED -- 1.5 subzonal units in relative duration (no subzone divisions)

Applied zonation of Kozur (2003) to Bithynian, which uses lower two zones of Boreal, then what had been subzones of Kocelia super-zone for upper two divisions.
	Pseudokeyserlingites guexi	246.71	dashed	DASHED -- The two Aegean zones are given equal durations.  Paracrochordiceras has equivalent of 5 subzones in Boreal realm.  
	Japonites welteri	247.06		Cycles and radio-isotope dating both suggests this age should be ~247 Ma.  Applied zonation of Kozur (2003) to Aegean.  Base-Anisian set using Menning cycle-strat as base of Rot (upper unit of Bundsandstein).  GTS04 -- Base-Anisian age proportionally assigned between base-Triassic of 251 Ma (Olenekian+Induan, new GSSP level => 15 subzone equivalents) and base-Curioni (237 Ma radiometric, 21 subzones).  
	Neopopanoceras haugi	247.71	dashed	Equivalent to K. subrobustus of Boreal [Orchard, May07 to Nicoll].  That zone spans LT6r through m9d-LT9r in Spitsbergen; Fig. 3 of Hounslow-Muttoni) => incredibly long (and would eliminate most of "Lower" Spathian (as they had to do on their diagram).  If use Ellesmere; then base-LT8r (dashed) = leaves a bit more room for underlying ammonite zones.
	Prohungarites-Subcolumbites	247.9	dashed	DASH -- Four Spathian zones below N. haugi given equal durations for now..  Approximately equivalent to base-Tozericeras pakistanum in Himalayas.

Szurlies (2004) has the conchostracan-version at about 75% up in his Magzone CG7n (which may be a small gap) = base of Detfurth cycles in Germanic system.  Four Spathian zones below N. haugi given equal durations for now.  T. cassianus is equivalent to 2 subzones (?, or short zones as drawn) (a higher contrarium and a lower euomphala) in Boreal scheme on SEPM chart.
	Anasiirites kingianus	248.56		Set as base of A. tardus (Boreal), which is middle of Hounslow-Muttoni LT6; which would be approximately middle of Szurlies'07 CG8n.  Very brief in Hounslow-Muttoni composite.

	Gyronites frequens	250.65		Bachmann-Kozur display base as about 1/4 up in Dienerian
	Pleurogyronites" planidorsatus - Discophiceras	251.05	dashed	DASH -- Zone in Bachmann-Kozur (2004) shown as spanning uppermost "Gangetian" (uppermost Griesbachian) and lowermost Dienerian => spans the substage boundary (put at approximate middle of zone).
	Ophiceras tibeticum	251.42	dashed	DASH -- Revised (Kozur'04) zonation for Griesbachian substage has uncertain correlations, therefore each zone (3.5) are dashed as equal duration.
	Otoceras woodwardi	251.79	dashed	DASH -- Revised (Kozur'04) zonation for Griesbachian substage has uncertain correlations, therefore each zone (3.5) are dashed as equal duration.
	Otoceras fissisellatum	252.16		Radiometric age on GSSP = Control Age !   Bowring dating (in Chen et al., 2010)  suggests this should be 252.16 Ma.  Revised (Kozur'04) zonation for Griesbachian substage has uncertain correlations, therefore each zone (3.5) are dashed as equal duration.

	Phisonites triangulus	254.2		Kozur (2003) uses as base of Changhsingian.
	Vedioceras ventroplanum	255.36	dashed	DASHED -- Kozur (2003) has base at base of Clarkina transcaucasica Conodont zone, but this is same level where Davydov GTS2004 places base of the underlying Aroxoceras latum Zone.  Therefore, it is shifted upward to base of next higher Clarkina orientalis Conodont zone in this chart.
	Araxoceras latum	259.32	dashed	DASHED -- Begins at about 70% up in C. postbitteri Conodont zone on Henderson'12 chart.  In GTS04 -- Base is coeval with base of Fusulinid zone Lf2 (=base of Conodont Lc4; GTS2004 composite standard), but Kozur (2003) assigns about 2 myr earlier (base of Lc3).

	Timorites - Waagenoceras	266.6	dashed	DASH -- Base coeval with base of Fusulinid zone Gf4 in Davydov's composite standard (GTS2004).  However, unclear what is basal marker.  Zone of Kozur (2003) has assumption that Midian regional stage begins in mid-Wordian, unlike GTS2004 correlation set; however, the name of his zone allows a lot of leeway!
	Waagenoceras	269.68		FAD at about 75% up in Roadian on Henderson'12 chart.  GTS04 -- Base is middle of the Roadian.  Important marker for late Roadian and younger Guadalupian.

	Juresanites	297.04		Base of S. fusus - M. simulata Conodont zone in Henderson'12 chart
	Svetlanoceras	298.88		Henderson (2005) states that "typical Permian ammonoids, like Sventlanoceras primore, occur slightly higher than the GSSP level; so an arbitrary 0.2 myr is included here.
	Shumardites	301.09		NOTE:  Heckel (e-mail; Aug11) recombines Pa12 (Shumardites - Emilites) and Pa11 (Aristoceras - Vidrioceras) as a single "Shumardites-Vidrioceras" zone; therefore removed this "output" for now.  Davydov'12 equates with base of C.simplex Conodont zone.  GTS04 = DASH -- Apprximaely at base of Orenburgian regional stage (about 50% up in Gzehelian)
	Vidrioceras / Artinskia	303.67		Base of Gzhelian Stage.  NOTE:  Heckel (e-mail; Aug11) recombines Pa12 (Shumardites - Emilites) and Pa11 (Aristoceras - Vidrioceras) as a single "Shumardites-Vidrioceras" zone

Conodont zonation (selected)	block	180	233/236/173	notitle		TRIASSIC = Tethyan zones of Kozur'03 with Early Triassic modified after Orchard'07; PERMIAN-CARBONIFEROUS = GTS2012 diagrams of Henderson and of Davydov (zones used for Spline-fit of this age scale); DEVONIAN = Becker (GTS2012) suite used for spline-fit age model; SILURIAN = "Standard" of Mike Melchin in GTS2012; ORDOVICIAN = North Atlantic conodont zones (Figure 2.2 in Webby et al. (2004; The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event); with ages (and some zones) modified by Roger Cooper (chart of Nov'2010 for GTS2012).  Cooper's placement relative to Australia "Conop/spline-fit" zones is used here.); CAMBRIAN = South China zones by Chen et al (2010 pers. commun. to J.Ogg; during sessions at Nanjing Inst. Geol. Paleont.) as scaled by Peng and Babcock (GTS2012 graphics)
	TOP	201.4		Assigned as coincident with top of C. crickmayi ammonite zone = end of Triassic ammonites (using Kozur and Lucas diagrams)
	Misikella ultima	202.16		Kozur (2010; pers. comm.) shifts base downward to base-Marshi. Kozur (2003) had shown this zone as uppermost Rhaetian (upper-half of Ch. marshi subzone).  Krystyn (in Gallet et al., 2007) indicates FAD at about 1/4th up in Rhaetian portion of "K" normal-polarity zone.
	Misikella posthernsteini (M. koessenensis s.z.)	203.69		Base of E21r (sets base of M. koess. s.z.).  M. koessenensis S.Z. called M. rhaetica Zone by Krystyn (in Gallet et al., EPSL, 2007).  Ranges of both taxa are coeval -- base in lower "I" normal-zone, and top at about 1/3rd up in "K" normal-zone.  Kozur (2003) shows base level with base of his V. stuerzenbaumi ammonite subzone.
	Misikella posthernsteini (M. hernsteini-M. posthern. s.z.)	209.46		Defines base of Rhaetian.  Set as 95% up in E17n under OptionA of Houslow-Muttoni (similar to Husing-Deened et al; but one reversed-zone higher).  Concise GTS -- FAD in middle of "B" Reversed-magzone (Gallet et al., 2007); which they indicate is middle of E21r.1r = age for base Rhaetian. .  FAD in middle of "B" Reversed-magzone (Gallet et al., 2007).  GTS04 -- Tentative magnetostratigraphy correlation to middle of combined Chron E22n of Newark polarity pattern in GTS04. FAD of Misik. posternsteini " is "OPTION 1" for base of Rhaetian (used here).  It appears more or less concurrently (in Tethys) with E. mosher (in N.Amer.)" [Orchard, Oct'05, e-mail to J.Ogg], and coincide with base of Coch. amoenum ammon. zone (=base of Rhaetian => a possible secondary marker, depending on final choice of GSSP).  Genus of Misikella posthernsteini is also called Axiothea. Genus of "mosheri" was Epigondolella, but called Cypridodella by Orchard '05 and Orchardella by Kozur '03.  Tethyan M.posthernsteini zone subdivided in Kozur'03 into upper M.koessensis and lower M.hernsteini-M.posthernsteini subzones at level corresponding to base of Vand. stuerzenbaumi ammonite subzone.
	Misikella hernsteini-P. andrusovi	211.45		FAD coincides with base of S. reticulatus (now M. spinescens) ammonite zone (uppermost Late Norian) in Austria (Krystyn and Kuerschner, 2005, Albertiana 32, p.18). Base of this brief zone shown in Kozur'03 as mid-Sagenites reticulatus ammonite zone in his alternate Norian/Rhaetian ammonite zonation, but he writes (2006 to J. Ogg) that the level might correspond to base of S. reticulatus (used here)
	Mockina bidentata	215.23		Base of "bidentata" zone is apparently lower in Tethys relative to N.Amer. (Kozur'03 assigned as base-Macer).
	Mockina postera	216.48		Base set as 1/4th up in Kozur's Tethyan M. columbianus zone (due to relative number of conodont zones in his chart (Bachmann-Kozur, 2004).  Kozur (2003) indicates that 2 1/2 zones of N.Amer. correspond to his M. postera Zone, therefore assigned here as equal (3) divisions for bases.  Genus of "postera" was Epigondolella, but called Cypridodella by Orchard '05 and Mockina by Kozur '03.  FAD is base of Tethyan of same name (Kozur, 2006 letter to J.Ogg).  "elongata" Genus was Epigondolella, but called Cypridodella by Orchard '05 (used here) and Orchardella by Kozur '03.
	Epigondolella spiculata	216.9		Base is base of Kozur's Tethyan M. columbianus ammonite zone.  Genus was Epigondolella, but called Cypridodella by Orchard '05  and Mockina by Kozur '03.
	Mockina medionorica	217.42		Base (Tethyan) = base of C. bicrenatus Zone.  Equated to Drep. rutherfordi ammonite zone (Canada).   Genus was Epigondolella, but called Cypridodella by Orchard '05 and Orchardella by Kozur '03.  "M. medionorica corresponds to M. multidentata" (Kozur'03; p.70) .
	Epigondolella triangularis - Norigondolella hallstattensis	221.34		Middle of M. paulckei Zone (Tethys) or Middle of Malayites dawsoni Zone (Canada).  E. triangularis has rare occurrences earlier (Kozur, written to J. Ogg, 2006)
	Epigondolella quadrata	226.44		Potential base of Norian.  Middle of G. jandianus ammonite zone.  GTS04 scaled as about 80% up in Stik. kerri ammonite zone (Canada).  Kozur's general diagram has as a simple mid-Kerri.
	Epigondolella orchardi - Norigondolella navicula (N.Tethys) / Metapolygnathus primitivus (S.Tethys)	228.35		Was assigned to base of Norian (Kozur, written to J.Ogg, 2006).  See note below on M. communisti zonal span.  Discussions of base-Norian seem to imply FAD just below the base of S.kerri ammonite zone.
	Carnepigondolella pseudodiebeli	229.72		Carnepigondolelli (= former Metapolygnathus of some species) pseudodiebeli FAD is base of K. macrolobatus zone (Kozur'03 diagram). 
	Carnepigondolella zoae	231.21	dashed	DASHED -- C. zoae zone is shown in Kozur'03 in both Tethys and N.Amer. as (mid-Trop.welleri.; but Orchard (relayed to Nicoll, May 07) uses M. nodosus (although see his comments to J.Ogg in note below).
	Metapolygnathus carpathicus	232.86		There was a Meta. nodosus Zone drawn in GTS2004 with base at about 80% up in T. dilleri Zone.  "However, "Meta. nodosus in the sense of Orchard'91 is very broad and furthermore encompased M. carpathicus.  I have a major revision of this group pending.  Carpathicus morphs do appear BEFORE nodosus s.s., so a zone of that name could be used." [Orchard, Oct'05 e-mail to Ogg]  Kozur'03 has such a zone in lower Tropites welleri ammonite zone, beginning at about 80% up in T.dilleri, therefore I presume that this reflects a revised FAD of Meta. carpathica (and I've dropped Meta.nodosus; plus used Kozur'03 name for N.Amer. zone (his Carnepigondolella lindae -- assumed that name-species has FAD at base).
	Para. postinclinata - Paragondolella noah 	233.5		M. polygnathiformis is new zone by Orchard (May 207 relayed to Nicoll).  P. post-P. noah Kozur'03 zone (defined by LAD of G. tethydis at base => Gap zone) has its base at base of Tuvalian substage (base T, dilleri); and age/marker from SEPM matches definition of underlying zone.
	Gladigondolella tethydis - Paragondolella postinclinata I.Z.	235.39		Begins at base of T. aonides Zone (Kozur, 2006, to Jim Ogg).  Assumed from I.Z. name that FAD of P. postinclinata is at base.
	Budurovignahus diebeli - Paragondolella polygnathiformis	237		Base of D. canadiensis (new base of Carnian) = Orchard's new zone (2007) and Kozur's.  Kozur'03 assigns base of this zone as coeval with base of Daxatina canadiensis or Frankites sutherlandi ammonite zone (his preferred base of Carnian); but also shows base of N.Amer. Meta. polygnathiformis zone as same level.
	Budurovignathus n. sp. (Kozur)	237.9		Kozur (2003) called this Budurovignathus supralongobardica, but wrote in 2006 (to Jim Ogg) to call this n.sp. until described.  Genus of "inclinata" was Paragondolella genus, but Orchard (email, Oct'05 to Ogg) says "Paragondolella is NOT suitable for inclinata or polygnathiformis based on Multimultiple-element"; therefore, I assumed it is Metapolygnathus (same genus as polygnathiformis).  Kozur'03 Tethys zone has same base (base of Frank. regoledanus ammonite zone), so assumed that FAD of its name-species is same level.
	Budurovignathus mungoensis	239.1		Base of Kozur's Budu. mongoensis Zone is at base of P. archelaus Zone (used here); Base of a P.foliata Zone was at base of M. meginae Zone on GTS2004 chart, but no longer used?
	Budurovignathus hungaricus	240.3		Base is essentially base of Gredleri ammonite zone.  GTS2004 projects base of this conodont zone as base of Protrachy. margaritosum s.z. (mid-Fassanian substage).  The FAD is diagrammed in Muttoni et al (Anis-Ladin time scale)
	Budurovignathus truempyi	240.9		FAD is middle of Curioni Zone.  Kozur'03 shows this Zone (and the FAD of name-species) as equivalent to a "E.? recubariense" ammonite subzone.
	Paragondolella? trammeri trammeri - Neogondolella aequidentata	242.03		Kozur'03 shows this zone beginning about 1/3rd up in Nevadites Zone, therefore assumed it is base of its Serp. serpianensis subzone.  Presumed FAD of second name-species.
	Paragondolella? trammeri trammeri - Paragondolella alpina	242.34		FAD of "P. trammeri" put at base of Aplococeras avisianum SubZone by Bachmann-Kozur'04, which is shifted downward by one ammonite zone form Sweet.  Krystyn has "P. trammeri" zone beginning at same level.
	Paragondolella alpina - Paragondolella? trammeri praetrammeri	242.57		Kozur'03 shows this zone beginning at base of R.reitzi ammonite zone. 
	Neogondolella mesotriassica	243.05		Kozur'03 shows this zone (and presumed FAD of name-species) beginning at base of "Kellnerites felsoeoersensis Zone" of Hungary.  Things get really tight in this interval!
	Neogondolella constricta	243.76		Kozur'03 shows this zone (and FAD of name-species) beginning at base of S. aviticus ammonite subzone.
	Paragondolella bifurcata	244.23		Base of Kozur's Para. bifurcata zone (and FAD of name-species) is base of Schr. binodosus ammonite Subzone.  GTS2004 projects base of the long Para. excelsa conodont zone of N.Amer. to be approximately middle of H. minor s.z. of A. varium Zone, which is nearly same age => put synchronous here.; and I presumed that this is also FAD of the name-species.  
	Paragondolella bulgarica (Nicoraella kockeli s.z.)	244.94		Kozur'03 subzonal scheme suggests FAD of N.kockeli is also base of Pelsonian; SEPM has "G. hanbulogi" FAD at same level.
	Paragondolella bulgarica (Nicoraella germanica s.z.)	246.36		Kozur'03 shows this zone (and presumed FAD of name-species) beginning at base of Bithynian (but he has a different ammonite zonal scheme).  He also suggests a N. shoshoenensis horizon in middle, and extending upward into lower half of his Para. bulgarica Zone.
	Neogondolella? regalis	246.71		Kozur'03 shows this zone (and FAD of name-species) beginning at middle of Aegean sub-stage (baes of his P. guexi ammonite zone).  GTS04 Base of Zone (and maybe FAD of name-species?) at base of Keyer. subrobustus zone = upper-Spathian; but Kozur's is used here.
	Chiosella timorensis	247.06		Is base of Anisian, by definition at suggested GSSP
	Chiosella gondolelloides	247.27		Upper 1/3rd of N. haugi or K. subrobustus ammonite zone (67% up in K. sub. used here).  Kozur'03 displays zone (and implied name-species?) as 5/6ths up in Spathian
	Triassospathodus sosioensis	247.45		65% up in Spathian on Orchard's schematic diagram; but lowered to mid-way between Ch. gond. and Neosp. triang. to avoid overlaps.  Kozur'03 displays zone (and FAD of name-species) as 4/6ths up in Spathian.
	Neospathodus triangularis	247.62		60% up in Spathian on Orchard's schematic diagram.  Kozur'03 displays zone (and implied name-species?) as 3/6ths up in Spathian.  The implied FAD of "triangularis" is much higher in sequence, and about 1.5 myr younger, than the "base-Spathian" placement by Sweet. Genus of "triangularis" was formerly Neospathodus, and Kozur uses "Triassospathodus" (used here), but Orchard (2005 email to Ogg) says "not yet reconstructed.
	Icriospathodus collinsoni	248.27		Kozur'03 displays zone (and name-species) as 1/6th up in Spathian (base of C. parisianus Zone).  The implied FAD of "collinson" is lower in sequence (and 0.4 myr older) than given by Sweet. Genus of "collinson" was formerly Neospathodus.
	Neospathodus pingdingshanensis	248.46		Base of Spathian (Zhao et al., 2007)
	Borinella buurensis - Scythogondolella milleri	249.24		Base of Zone assigned as FAD of B. buurensis; but range of S. milleri is better for Tethyan  FAD of Borinella buurensis is approximately middle of Smithian and goes to base of Spathian.  BUT, it is not common in Tethyan sections.
	Neospathodus waageni	250.01		First N. waageni is subspecies "N. waageni eowaageni" at Chaohu candidate GSSP => set as base-Dienerian.  Kozur assigned this as "Neospathodus waageni - Scythogondolella meeki" zone (although definition of top is uncertain).  GTS04: Time-transgressive or uncertain (sketched as slanted line from uppermost H. hedenstroemi to base of A. tardus) => DASH it as mid-E. romunduri.  Kozur'03 simply shows base as middle of lower-Smithain ammonite zone (used here).  Genus of "waageni" was formerly Neospathodus (and used that way by Kozur'03), but Orchard assigns as "probably a Novispathodus.  Neospathodus retained for now.
	Neospathodus dieneri Morph 3	250.22		LAD of S. kummeli is in lower part of N. dieneri Morph 3 zone (Zhao et al., 2007); assigned a middle of N. dieneri Morph 3 zone.
	Sweetospathodus kummeli	250.86		FADs put essentially at base of Dienerian in Orchard (2007).  Kozur'03 shows base of N.dieneri zone at base of second Dienerian ammonite zone, vs. 0.1 unit from Base in Sweet.  Placed here at top (0.5 unit) of cluster of FADs.
	Neogondollela krystyni	251.31		Genus as preferred by Orchard (May'07).  Kozur (2003) had used "Clarkina" carinata for this zone, but he wrote (2006, to Jim Ogg) that "Clarkina" krystyni is preferable for now.  Note that all Perm/Tri boundary Neogondollela are now assigned as "Clarkina" by some boundary workers, e.g., Kozur 2003 (why?).  "Carinata" zone eliminated by Sweet (1986), but used by Kozur (who also implied that FAD of carinata is perhaps one-third up in Oph. tibeticum ammonite zone (used here). Kozur (2003) had an overlying zone of Clarkina postcarinata, beginning at about 2/3rds up in Oph. tibeticum ammonite zone.  However, he wrote (2006, to Jim Ogg) that this species is not described, therefore to not use this zone.
	Isarcicella isarcica	251.79		Sweet considers 'Anchignathodus parvus' to be junior synonym of I. isarcica.  FAD = 1 time unit from Griesbachian base = (1/3.5) of u. Griesbachian duration
	Hindeodus parvus	252.16		Meishan GSSP boundary dating = FIXED age (from Shen et al., 2010; Bowring ages in Lopingian paper)  FAD of H. parvus = Base of Triassic, by definition.  Kozur (2003) estimates duration of H. parvus zone to be 0.1 myr, which is fairly consistent with Sweet's scaling.
	Clarkina zhejiangensis - C. meishanensis 	252.53		Base is 94% up from the base of the Changhsingian, and zone is only about 100 kyr in duration.  Called Clarkina deflecta in scale by B. Wardlaw (pers. commun., May, 2005).
	Clarkina deflecta - C. yini	252.81		Base is 80% up from the base of the Changhsingian.  Kozur (2003) considers this as a horizon, and uses a slighly higher and brief Clarkina iranica zone instead for Tethys; followed by a brief Clarkina praemeishanensis.  Essentially, conodont workers have achieved an ultra-high subdivision of latest Permian.
	Clarkina changxingensis 	253.14		NOTE spelling difference.  Base is 50% up from the base of the Changhsingian.
	Clarkina subcarinata	253.56		Base is 25% up from the base of the Changhsingian.
	Clarkina wangi	254.2		Base is the base of the Changhsingian at the GSSP.
	Clarkina longicuspidata	254.61		Used name of Henderson'12 chart;  was Clarkina inflecta on spline-fit
	Clarkina orientalis	255.36		Base is 70% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.
	Clarkina transcaucasica	256.59		Base is 60% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.
	Clarkina guangyuanensis	257.23		Base is 55% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.
	Clarkina leveni	257.82		Base is 30% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.
	Clarkina asymmetrica	258.54		Base is 20% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.  Kozur (2003) has a zone Clarkina niuzhuangerensis in same placement (a synonym?)
	Clarkina dukouensis	259.11		Base is 5% up from the base of the Wuchiapingian.
	Clarkina postbitteri postbitteri	259.81		Base is the base of the Wuchiapingian (GSSP).
	Clarkina postbitteri hongshuiensis	260.32	dashed	DASHED Base is 90% up from the base of the Capitanian.
	Jinogondolella granti	260.83		On Henderson (2005) diagram, but not Wardlaw (2006, pers. commun.); therefore, not given as zone here.  FAD is an arbitrary 80% up from base of Capitanian.
	Jinogondolella xuanhanensis	261.87		On Henderson (2005) diagram, but not Wardlaw (2006, pers. commun.); therefore, not given as zone here.  FAD is an arbitrary 70% up from base of Capitanian.
	Jinogondolella prexuanhanensis	262.77		On Henderson (2005) diagram, but not Wardlaw (2006, pers. commun.); therefore, not given as zone here.  FAD is an arbitrary 60% up from base of Capitanian.
	Jinogondolella altudaensis	264.04		Base is middle of the Capitanian.  Kozur 2003) uses Mesogondolella for the Jinogondolella genus.
	Jinogondolella shannoni	264.59		On Henderson (2005) diagram, but not Wardlaw (2006, pers. commun.); therefore, not given as zone here.  Base is 25% up from the base of the Capitanian. Kozur 2003) makes this a separate zone, and uses Mesogondolella for the Jinogondolella genus.
	Jinogondolella postserrata	265.14		Base Is the base of the Capitanian (GSSP). Kozur 2003) uses Mesogondolella for the Jinogondolella genus.
	Jinogondolella aserata	268.8		Base is the base of the Wordian (GSSP). Kozur 2003) uses Mesogondolella for the Jinogondolella genus.
	Jinogondolella nankingensis	272.3		Base is the base of the Roadian (GSSP). Kozur 2003) uses Mesogondolella for the Jinogondolella genus.
	Mesogondolella lamberti - Neostreptognathodus sulcoplicatus - Meso. idahoensis	273.71	dashed	NOT IN SPLINE -- Base is 80% up from the base of the Kungurian in Henderson (2005) diagram
	Sweetognathus guizhouensis	274.76	dashed	NOT IN SPLINE -- Base is about 65% up from the base of the Kungurian in Henderson (2005) diagram
	Neostreptognathodus prayi	275.53		40% up in Kungurian.  Base is 45% up from the base of the Kungurian in Henderson (2005) diagam, but apparent coincidence with Foram zone of base-Filippovian regional substage (2 substages up in Kungurian-Ufimian) suggests a slightly lower placement allows more room for events.
	Neostreptognathodus pnevi	279.33		Base is base of the Kungurian.
	Neostreptognathodus pequopensis	281.95		Base is 75% up from the base of the Artinskian.  Precursor to Neostrepto. pnevi that is a marker for base of Kungurian.
	Sweetognathus clarki	284.12		From Spline -- Base is 70% up (about 285 Ma on GTS2012 scale) from the base of the Sakmarian.  Included by Henderson, but not in GTS2004.
	Sweetognathus "whitei	290.06		Base is base of the Artinskian
	Sweetognathus anceps - Mesogondolella bisselli - Meso. visibilis - Meso. lata	293.61	dashed	Base is 90% up from the base of the Sakmarian.  Included by Henderson, but not in GTS2004; threfore, not shown here as a zone.  This genera, which is more abundant in deeper water, is a secondary marker for base-Kungurian.
	Sweetognathus binodosus	294.15	dashed	DASHED Base is 80% up in Sakmarian on GTS04 Fig 16.1 (Wardlaw, Perm chapter) and Henderson'05 diagram.  Not a numbered zone of Davydov.
	Sweetognathus merrilli - Neogondolella uralensis	295.53		Base of the Sakmarian.  Davydov's zone Cc7 has a base about 15% up in Sakmarian, but marker is not given.

	Streptognathodus sigmoidalis - Strept. cristellaris	298.11		0
	Streptognathodus isolatus	298.88		Base of Asselian.  Streptognathodus invaginatus has same FAD, and is a second marker for this zone (Kozur, 2003, Permophiles)
	Streptognathodus wabaunsensis - St. fissus	299.95		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Same level as USA event (base of Lecompton cycle).  Davydov (GTS04) had at about 80% above base in Gzhelian Stage, which is similar.
	Streptognathodus simplex - Streptognathodus bellus	301.09		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = DASH -- Davydov (GTS04) had base of "Streptognathodus simplex" at about 55% in Gzhelian Stage (and used here), but also at base of Noginski horizon).  Russian chart (2006) puts at about 15% up in Daixina sokensis foram-zone (which is equivalent to Noginski horizon), so I assume these are similar.  
	Streptognathodus virgilicus	302.12		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = DASH at same level as USA event (base of Lecompton cycle).  Davydov (GTS04) had at about 30% above base in Gzhelian Stage
	Streptognathodus vitali	302.87		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Same level as USA event (base of Lecompton cycle).  Davydov (GTS04) had at about15% above base in Gzhelian Stage; which is similar level.
	Streptognathodus simulator	303.67		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Proposed "best" Base of Gzhelian by Heckel et al.  Was used by Davydov (GTS04) for base-age also. Base MFS of Oread major cycle.  However, Russian chart (2006) splits into lower S. firmus, and higher S. simulator zones.
	Streptognathodus firmus	304.14		NEW in GTS2012
	Idiognathodus toretzianus	304.54		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Heckel's diagram (pers. commun. Dec07) equates base of R. quasiarcticus Foram zone with base of S. gracilis Conodont zone, but it is also coeval with base of I. toretzianus zone.  Therefore, age is calibrated to that cycle-controlled age of S. gracilis in N.Amer.  70% above base in Kasimovian Stage
	Streptognathodus cancellosus	305.17		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Equated to base of same zone in Heckel scheme
	Idiognathodus sagittalis	305.75		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Alternative definition for base of Kazimovian.  Seems coeval with Idiognathodus eccentricus of Heckel's zonal scheme; hence that age is used here.  GTS04 projected as 30% above base in Kasimovian Stage, which is similar.
	Streptognathodus subexcelsus - Sw. makhlinae	306.99		Base of Kasimovian Stage.
	Neognathodus roundyi - Streptognathodus cancellosus	309.02		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = Equated to Heckel's scheme.  GTS04 had as 70% above base in Moscovian Stage, which is essentially the same level.
	Neognathodus medexultimus-Streptognathodus concinnus	310.89		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = 45% above base in Moscovian Stage in GTS04 chart (Davydov's graphical correlation)
	Streptognathodus dissectus	312.62		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = 30% above base in Moscovian Stage in GTS04 chart (Davydov's graphical correlation)
	Neognathodus uralicus	314.5		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = 10% above base in Moscovian Stage.  in GTS04 chart (Davydov's graphical correlation).  Assumed that this is also LAD of D. donetzianus, but GTS2004 Fig 15.1 is a bit confusing here.
	Declinognathodus donetzianus	315.16		Base of Moscovian
	Neognathodus atokaensis	317.05		From GT2012 spline fit
	Declinognathodus marginodosus	318.65		From GT2012 spline fit

	Lochriea ziegleri	330.92		NEW BASE OF SERPUKHOVIAN:  From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = DASHED at middle of Foram Zone Mf14 (=> about 90% up in GTS04 version of Visean) 
	Lochriea nodosa	332.03		From GT2012 spline fit
	Lochriea mononodosa	334.92		From GT2012 spline fit
	Gnathodus bilineatus	336.73	dashed	DASH.  Assuming Lane's G. bilineatus (Zone 9) has same base; then Brenckle equates this to Foram assemblages suggesting base of Foram Zone Mf13.  Note, however, that Davydov (GTS04) had DASH at middle of Foram Zone Mf11 (=> about 40% up in Visean Stage).
	Gnathodus praebilineatus	340.09		From GT2012 spline fit.  NOT IN GTS04/08
	Gnathodus texanus	343.96		From GT2012 spline fit.  GTS08 = DASH -- Davydov's chart has at 15% above base of Visean; but the G. texanus is considered to be a useful (but not always consistent) working marker for base-Visean by Sevastopulo and Devuyst (Carb. Newsletter, 2005); therefore, set here as base-Visean.
	Gnathodus pseudosemiglaber - Scaliognathus anchoralis	346.73		USED AS BASE-VISEAN in Davydov chart.  GTS08 = DASH at 90% above base in Tournaisian Stage

	Palmatolepis punctata	380.38		28% up in Frasnian Stage.  
	Palmatolepis transitans	381.25		23% up in Frasnian Stage.  
	Mesotaxis guanwushanensis (= falsiovalis)	383.1		92% up in Givetian.  The lowerest subzone "Norrisi" which extends to top of Givetian was a separate Zone in GTS04 Devonian zonation.  Harris (USGS Open-File 2005-1343) also shows Mes. falsiovalis extending below the base-Frasnian).  Seems to correspond to "upper disparilis" zone of some older literature, or "lowermost asymmetrica Zone".  Confusing.  
	Klapperina disparilis	384.15		70% up in Givetian
	Schmidtognathus hermanni	384.99		55% above base in Givetian Stage.  Harris (2005-1343) calls this S. hermanni-Po. cristatus zone.
	Polygnathus varcus	387.3		8% up in Givetian
	Polygnathus hemiansatus	387.72		Base of Givetian Stage.
	Polygnathus ensensis	388.18		87% up in Eifelian.  Called P. xylus. ensensis zone in GTS04 (Not sure if this was a hypenated succession of 2 zones, with P. xylus above; or a species-subspecies notation.)  Harris (Open File 2005-1343) shows P. xylus. ensensis zone going across the boundary.   
	Tortodus kock. kockelianus	389.23		50% up in Eifelian
	Polygnathus costatus costatus	391.62		19% up in Eifelian
	Polygnathus costatus partitus	393.25		Base of Eifelian Stage.  Corresponds with major faunal turnover.  Note the subtle change in name -- patulus below, and partitus above, the boundary.

	Eocostapolygnathus gronbergi	404.55		26% up in the Emsian.  
	Eocostapolygnathus excavatus	406.11		13% up in the Emsian.  Formerly Polygnathus excavatus.  The level for the revised Emsian GSSP will be close to the incoming of the Polygnathus (or Eocostapolygnathus) excavatus group. 
	Eocostapolygnathus kitabicus	407.57		Base of Emsian Stage (current, but soon to be revised, definition).  Formerly Polygnathus kitabicus.

	Kockelella ortus ortus	431.02		NEW zone -- 70% up in C. rigidus
	Kockelella walliseri	431.6		NEW zone -- 40% up in C. rigidus
	Ozarkodina sagitta rhenana	432.36	dashed	DASH -- Essentially synchronous with base of M. belophorus Graptolite Zone in GTS04 diagram, therefore about 40% up in Sheinwoodian.  Johnson (2006) has this interval subdivided (from bottom) Oz. rhenana, K. walliseri, and K. arnsdeni Zones.
	Kockelella ranuliformis S.Z.	432.59		Coeval with base of M. riccartonensis graptolite zone.
	Pterospathodus pennatus procerus S.Z.	433.24		Base is coeval to about 15% up in Murchisoni graptolite zone.
	Pterospathodus amorphognathoides amorphognathoides	435.15		Base of Cyrtograptus lapworthi graptolite zone.   Johnson (2006) has Pterospathodus amorphognathoides interval subdivided (from bottom) P. a. amorphognathoides, Ps. bicornis, and Pt. p. procerus Zones.  A greatly modified version with 4 sub-species zones is in GTS2012, as submitted by Mike Melchin (based on Cramer?).
	Ptero. amorph. lithuanicus	435.4		About 75% up in O. spiralis graptolite zone.   Johnson (2006) has Pterospathodus amorphognathoides interval subdivided (from bottom) P. a. amorphognathoides, Ps. bicornis, and Pt. p. procerus Zones.  A greatly modified version wiht 4 sub-species zones is in GTS2012, as submitted by Mike Melchin (based on Cramer?).
	Ptero. amorph. lennarti	435.82		About 1/3rd up in O. spiralis graptolite zone. The former Pterospathodus amorphognathoides is now split in 4 sub-species zones.
	Pterospathodus amorphognathoides angulatus	436.39		About 1/3rd up in M. crenulata graptolite zone. The former Pterospathodus amorphognathoides is now split in 4 sub-species zones; and begins much lower than GTS04.  GTS04 had a large "Pterospathodus celloni" zone as 20% above base in Telychian (coeval with base-Crispus graptolite zone).  This was based on Johnson shows lower portion as a (new?) separate conodont zone (used here), therefore base of this shortened Celloni-zone is raised to Base of O. spiralis Graptolite zone.  Need definitions!

	Pterospathodus tenuis	440.25	dashed	DASH -- was Base of Aeronian in GTS04/08; not projected as about 40% up in D. pectinatus zone.
	Aspelunda expansa	441.17	dashed	DASH -- new (GTS2012) zone with base coeval with middle of C. cyphus graptolite zone.
	Distomodus kentuckyensis	443.83		NOTE:  "Standard" is perhaps a mis-nomer, because there were a LOT of changes between GTS04 and GTS2012!  From Mike Melchin (Aug'11): "As you can see, the conodont zonation is very substantially revised and refined. There are many new names and almost all zonal levels are either moved or new. This is based on recently published literature."  Partly from papers by Cramer?  For example; Rexroadus nathani was basal zone in GTS04/08; but is now removed; and "second" zone extends to base of Silurian.  Conodont zonal schemes are regional in Early Silurian, but more global in Middle and Late.  The Early Silurian scheme here is mainly from GTS04; but elaborated and rescaled to graptolite zones following schematic in Johnson (2006).  Basal zone of Silurian assumed to be Base of Rhuddanian.

Graptolite Zones (general)	block	150	210/212/215	notitle		This hybrid Ordovician Australian and "standard" Silurian suite was used to scale the Ordovician-Silurian (Cooper, Melchin, Sadler).  Devonian zonations (relaive to conodont "master" scale) are based on Thomas Becker's detailed chart (2010; delivered to Gradstein and Ogg)
	TOP	405.33	dashed	DASHED at 50% up in excavatus.  End of Lower Zlichov anoxic event - "The Lower Zlichov Event is associated with the extinction of the graptoloids" (House, Encycl. Brit.); and  "there is no time overlap between pelagic graptolites and ammonoids in the basal Emsian" (Becker and House, 2000, page 117), however, exact calibration of Lower Zlichov is uncertain.
	Neomonograptus pacificus	407.57		Base of kitabicus Conodont subzone.  New zone (not in GTS04)
	Neomonograptus yukonensis	409.08		68% up in kindlei Conodont subzone.  Formerly assigned as genus Monograptus yukonensis in GTS04
	Neomonograptus thomasi	410.25		90% up in steinachensis Conodont subzone.  New zone (not in GTS04)
	Neomonograptus falcarius	411.46		80% up in gilberti Conodont zone.  Formerly assigned as genus Monograptus falcarius in GTS04 (and 20% above base in Pragian!) in GTS04.
	Neomonograptus hercynicus	413.22	dashed	DASHED at 33% up in trigonicus Conodont zone.  Formerly assigned as genus Monograptus hercinicus in GTS04
	Monograptus praehercynicus	415.51	dashed	DASHED at 93% up in postwoshmidti Conodont zone
	Monograptus uniformis	419.2		Base of Lochkovian -- by GSSP Definition !!
	Monograptus transgrediens - perneri	421.26		Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; about 45% up in Pridoli is base of Monograptus transgrediens - perneri Zone.

	Monograptus lochkovensis - M. lochkov. branikensis	422.83		Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; about 3% up in Pridoli.  Two zones; but M. lochkovensis (non-overlap) begins only 
	Neocolonograptus ultimus	422.9	dashed	DASH -- ca. 2% up in Pridoli is base of M. ultimus Zone.
	Neocolonograptus parultimus	422.96		Dashed (plus stage).  Base of N. (formerly Monograptus) paraultimus is Base of Stage (maybe -- GSSP lacks graptolites below GSSP level).  Two zones; but N. ultimus begins only 0.13 myr above N. paraultimus according to Cooper-Sadler scaling in GTS04; and only 0.06 in GTS12.
	Monograptus formosus	423.69		Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; about 70% up in Ludfordian
	Neocucullograptus kozlowskii - Polonograptus podoliensis	424.54	dashed	DOTTED:  Base of Polonograptus podoliensis Zone put arbitrarily in lower third adjacent zone bases.  Therefore, most schemes combine with underlying Zone (done here; and in GTS04).
	Bohemograptus	424.96		Base is minor extinction level (specialized monograptid lineagers). This was base of Bohemograptus cornuatus - Polonograptus podoliensis Zone; but Polonograptus podoliensis is now (Melchin correction of Aug'11) combined here with overlying Neocucullograptus kozlowskii zone.  Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table. The genus-taxon "B. cornuatus" name seems not used in some charts (including Melchin's).  However, zonal name sometimes seems to have bohemicus and tenuis species (e.g., Johnson, 2006).  FAD of graptolite Monograptus helicoides is another basal marker (older CONOP version).  Base of zone is about 25% up in Ludfordian.
	Saetograptus leintwardinensis - linearis	425.57		Extinction level plectograptine graptolites.  Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; but "linearis" is not used as part of name in other publications.

	Monograptus riccartonensis - firmus	432.59		Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; 25% up in Sheinwoodian is base of Monograptus  riccartonensis Zone.  Commonly combined with overlying M. belophorus (as done here); new table has it combined with M. firmus (not a listed zone in GTS04; so uncertain about definition, etc.)
	Cyrtograptus murchisoni	433.35		Tied to Spline-CONOP12 table; revised correlations now put near to base of Sheinwoodian -- the current GSSP does not coincide with the base of the Cyrtograptus centrifugus Biozone, as was supposed when the GSSP was defined. Restudy recommends a slightly higher and correlatable level on condonts -- the Ireviken datum 2, which coincides approximately with the base of the murchisoni Graptolite Biozone.
	Cyrtograptus centrifugus	433.46		Base of C. centrifugus Zone WAS assumed to be Sheinwoodian WAS, and it was commonly combined with overlying C. murchisoni Zone. But, the current GSSP does not coincide with the base of the Cyrtograptus centrifugus Biozone, as was supposed when the GSSP was defined. Restudy recommends a slightly higher and correlatable level on condonts -- the Ireviken datum 2, which coincides approximately with the base of the murchisoni Graptolite Biozone.  C. centrifugus base is therefore about 98% up in Telychian.

This may be equivalent to the lower part of Zone N23 of Blow (1979); however, the base of N23 boundary is FAD of Globigerina calida calida & Sph. excavata (Blow, 1969), but these datums are not in Beggren's compilations (1985 or 1995).  However, this event probably is just below the LAD of G. fistulosus (Intro. notes to ODP Leg 138 volume, p.28 - Table 6).
	PL6	2.39		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl6" = Globigerinoides fistulosus Highest occurrence Zone (Indo-Pacific) was the 'Globorotalia miocenica -Globigerinoides fistulosus Interval Zone'  = [LAD of Globorotalia miocenica (in Atlantic) or LAD of Globorotalia pseudomiocenica (in Indo-Pacific)]  to  LAD of Globigerinoides fistulosus (Berggren et al., 1995).  It spans a portion of Zones N21 and N22 of Blow (1979).  The 'N22' concept of Blow (1969) is difficult to apply globally. [See discussion under Zone PL5 in Berggren et al. (1995a)]
	PL5 [Atl.]	3.13		This LAD occurs MUCH OLDER (3.47 Ma) in Indo-Pacific.  Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl5" is "Globorotalia miocenica Highest Occurrence Zone [Atl.], Globorotalia pseudomiocenica HO Zone [Pac.]" due to different markers in the two oceans for the Top.  Formerly, the 'Dentoglobigerina altispira -Globorotalia miocenica Interval Zone' = LAD of Dento. altispira to LAD of Globorotalia miocenica (Berggren et al., 1995).  In Indo-Pacific, the top is LAD of Globorotalia pseudomiocenica, which is coeval to G. miocenica.  It spans the majority of Zone N21 of Blow (1979); although definitions for the base of N21 differ: FAD of G. tosaensis, LAD of G. altispira, LAD of S. seminulina.  These have an age range of about 0.3 m.y.
	PL4 [Atl.]	3.16	dotted	Pliocene Foram Zone "PL4" Dentoglobigerina altispira Highest Occurrence Zone, was the 'Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina -Dentoglobigerina altispira Interval Zone' = LAD of Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina to LAD of Dento. altispira (Berggren et al., 1995).  It may span a portion of Zone N21 of Blow (1979).  This interval barely exists -- Berggren et al. (1995) and Wade et al'11 estimated a duration of 30,000 yr in the Atlantic (but older and longer in Pacific); and this scale has about 20,000 yr!  It is essentially equivalent to the lower Kaena polarity subchron (C2An.1r).
	PL5 [Pac.]	3.47	dotted	Base of Pacific PL5 -- This LAD is reported as much earlier (3.47 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 (Refs 1, 2, 5, 6) -- GTS2004 Neogene foram table. 
	PL4 [Pac.]	3.59	dashed	Base of Pacific PL4 -- This LAD is reported as much earlier (3.59 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Wade et al. (2011) "The duration of Biochron PL4 is estimated to be 30 kyr in the Atlantic Ocean and 110 kyr in the Pacific Ocean."  REFS: Wade et al. (2011); Shackleton et al. (1995)
	PL3	3.85	dashed	Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl3" Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina Highest Occurrence Zone (formerly the 'Globorotalia margaritae -Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina Interval Zone' = LAD of Globoturborotalia margaritae to LAD of Sphaerodinellopsis seminulina (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the upper portion of Zone 'N20' of Blow (1979).
	PL2	4.37		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl2" (or N20-N21) or Globorotalia margaritae Highest Occurrence Zone was the 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes -Globorotalia margaritae Interval Zone' = LAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes to LAD of Gt. margaritae (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the lower portion of Zone 'N20' of Blow (1979).
	PL1 (Atl.)	5.72	dashed	Pliocene Foram Zone PL1 (or N18-N19) Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent-range Zone was Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent Range Zone = FAD G. tumida to LAD G. nepenthes (Berggren et al., 1995)  Lourens et al (GTS2004) also place base of "M14" at this level, but Berggren used an earlier event.  There is no major Foram datum to mark the base of the Pliocene.History of zone and regional events are summarized in Berggren et al. (1995).   Miocene/Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl1a" WAS the 'Globorotalia tumida/Globorotalia cibaoensis Concurrent Range SubZone' (FAD of Globorotalia tumida to LAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and WAS equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N18' (or 'N19', which now begins BEFORE 'N18') of Blow (1979).  But, due to uncertainty in G. cibaoensis LAD, the subzones were removed in Wade et al'11.  [Miocene/Pliocene boundary interval Foram Zone "N18" is essentially non-existent in Berggren's table and GTS2004, because its base (FAD G. tumida) is now AFTER the base of N19 (FAD Sphaeroidinella dehiscens).]
	M14	6.14		Miocene Foram Zone "M14" Globigerinoides extremus Partial-range Zone (previously the 'Globorotalia lenguaensis -Globorotalia tumida Interval Zone') = LAD of Globorotalia lenguaensis to FAD of Globorotalia tumida (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the uppermost part of Zone 'N17' of Blow (1979).  Note that this essentially a "gap" zone.  [In contrast to Wade et al. (2011), Erik Anthonissen choose to honor both the Atlantic and Pacific calibrations and recognizes significant diachrony for the LAD of G. lenguaensis. The Atlantic event is no longer used by him as a zonal marker between M13b and M14 and the resulting zone in the Atlantic scheme is therefore a M14-M13b composite, pending further investigation.]
	M13	9.83	dashed	DASHED (see notes about diachroneity of FAD) -- Miocene Foram Zone M13 (or partial N16) is the Neogloboquadrina acostaensis/Globorotalia lenguaensis Concurrent Range Zone = FAD N. acostaensis to LAD of G. lenguaensis (Berggren et al., 1995); with 2 subzones.  Miocene Foram Zone "M13a" is the 'Neogloboquadrina acostaensis -Globigerinoides extremus/Globorotalia plesiotumida Interval SubZone' (FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis to FAD of Globig. extremus and/or Globorot.plesiotumida) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N16' of Blow (1979).  FAD of Globorotalia plesiotumida is difficult to determine under some conditions.  See extended discussion of subzone M13a/M13b limits in Berggren et al. (1995).
	M12	10.46	dashed	DASHED due to diachroneity of marker.  Miocene Foram Zone "M12" (or N15) is Globigerinoides trilobus Partial-range Zone (formerly the 'Neogloboquadrina mayeri -Neogloboquadrina acostaensis Interval Zone') = (LAD of Neogloboquadrina mayeri to FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N15' of Blow (1979).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone, but is characterized by presence of Globorotalia menardii.
	M11	11.63		Miocene Foram Zone "M11" (or N14) "Globoturborotalita nepenthes/Paragloborotalia mayeri Concurrent-range Zone" [Renamed to reflect inclusion of the species mayeri in the genus Paragloborotalia -- was the 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes/Neogloboquadrina mayeri Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes to LAD of Neogloboquadrina mayeri) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N14' of Blow (1979).
	M10	11.79		VERY BRIEF Miocene Foram Zone "M10" (or N13) Globigerinella praesiphonifera Partial-range Zone [was the 'Globorotalia fohsi robusta -Globoturborotalita nepenthes Interval Zone'] = (LAD of Fohsella fohsi robusta/lobata to FAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to upper portion of Zone 'N13' of Blow (1979).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone, which may explain its apparent brief extent (0.15 myr) in the global compilation.  However, in some regions, a further subdivision into 2 subzones can be made by Globigerinoides ruber.
	M9	13.41		Miocene Foram Zone "M9" (or N12) Fohsella fohsi Taxon-range Zone [was the Globorotalia fohsi lobata-globorotalia fohsi robusta Interval Zone] = FAD to LAD of F. fohsi (Berggren et al., 1995; redefined in Wade et al'11).  Base is same as base of N12 of Blow (1969, 1979), and top is probably near mid-N13.  Magnetochronologic calibration of boundaries is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy in DSDP Hole 563 by Wright and Miller (1992).  Two subzones -- Miocene Foram SubZone "M9a" Fohsella fohsi Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was the 'Globorotalia fohsi lobata Lineage SubZone'] is equivalent to "old" (initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata to evolutionary FAD of its descendent Globorotalia fohsi robusta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to lower portion of Zone 'N12' of Blow (1979).  Miocene Foram Zone "M8" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str. Lineage Zone' ( initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi s.str. to initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N11' of Blow (1979).  However, species "lobata" apparently combined with Fohsella "fohsi" in zonal scheme of Lourens et al. (in GTS2004).  This effectively removed the thin "M8" of Berggren et al., 1995.
	M8	13.77		Fohsella 'praefohsi' Lowest-occurrence Zone is defined by Wade et al (2011) as interval from FAD of F. "praefohsi" to FAD of F. fohsi.  Equivalent to N11 of Blow'69, and upper part of OLD M7 of Berggren et al'95.
	M7	14.24		Miocene Foram Zone "M7" (or N10-N11) is the 'Globorotalia peripheroacuta Lineage Zone' (FAD of Globorotalia peripheroacuta to the FAD of GFohsella "praefohsi") (Berggren et al., 1995), and base is equivalent to base of Zone 'N10' of Blow (1979).
	M6	15.1		Miocene Foram Zone "M6" (or N9) Orbulina suturalis Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the 'Globorotalia peripheroronda Partial Range Interval Zone'] = (FAD of Orb. suturalis to FAD of Globorotalia peripheroacuta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N9' of Blow (1979).  This is a very brief interval the global compilation of datums.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; ref [b] which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6, but table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis". 
	M5	16.38		Miocene Foram Zone M5 (or N8) Praeorbulina sicana Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the Praeorbulina sicana-Orbulina suturalis Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995)] = FAD of P. sicana to FAD of O. suturalis; equivalent to Zone "N8" of Blow (1969, 1979.  Two subzones:  VERY SHORT Miocene Foram Zone "M5a" is Praeorbulina sicana Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was 'Praeorbulina sicana -Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. Interval Subzone'] = (FAD of Praeorbulina sicana to FAD of Pr. glomerosa sensu stricto) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This short subzone spans the lowermost part of the 'N8' zone.  The base of this zone is used to denote the base of the Langhian Substage (base of Middle Miocene), although this boundary may be more closely associated with the slightly younger FAD of Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. (base of Subzone 'M5b'), which would render this substage about 0.3 myr shorter in duration.
	M4	17.54		Miocene Foram Zone "M4" (or N7) Globigerinoides bisphericus Partial-range Zone [was Catapsydrax dissimilis-Praeorbulina sicana Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995)]; equivalent to N7 of Blow (1969, 1979), and defined as LAD of C. dissimilis and/or C. unicavus to FAD of P. sicana; with 2 subzones.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone of 1 myr.  Miocene Foram Zone "M4a" is 'Catapsydrax dissimilis -Globorotalia birnageae Interval SubZone" (LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus to FAD of Globorotalia birnageae) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This subzone spans the lower part of the 'N7' zone.  Subzone "M4b" Fohsella birnageae Lowest Occurrence Subzone [was 'Globigerinoides bisphericus Partial Range Zone' (FAD of Globorotalia birnageae to FAD of Praeorbulina sicana) (Berggren et al., 1995)].  This short subzone spans the upper part of the 'N7' zone; but now is within the "overlying" M5!
	M3	19.3		Miocene Foram Zone "M3"Globigerinatella sp. / Catapsydrax dissimilis Concurrentrange Zone = FAD of Globigerinatella sp. to LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis.   This M3 is REDEFINED (and extended about 1.5 myr lower) by Wade et al'11 from previous M3 of 'Globigerinatella insueta/Catapsydrax dissimilis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Globigerinatella insueta to LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus) (Berggren et al., 1995), which was equivalent to the 'N6' zone.
	M2	21.12		Miocene Foram Zone "M2" (or N5) Globoquadrina binaiensis Partial-range Zone [was 'Catapsydrax dissimilis Partial Range Zone'] = (LAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globigerinatella sp. (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is equivalent to the 'N5' zone.  Note that this 3 m.y. zone is essentially a "gap" zone.
	M1	22.96		Miocene Foram Zone "M1" is the Globorotalia kugleri Total Range Zone (Berggren et al., 1983), defined by total range of G. kugleri; with 2 subzones.  Miocene Foram Zone "M1a" is 'Paragloborotalia' kugleri Lowest-occurrence Subzone = (FAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globoquadrina dehiscens) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is approximately coeval to the 'N4a' subzone of Srinivasan & Kennett (1981); but -- Wade (email Oct'11 to J.Ogg) "Base of N4 and M1 are not the same. Zone M1 defined by base Paragloborotalia kugleri.   Zone N4 (as per Kennett and Srinivasan, 1983) defined by base common occurrence of Globigerinoides primordius = 23.6 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004).
	O7	25.21		Oligocene Foram Zone O7 (new zone of Wade et al'11) "Paragloborotalia" pseudokugleri Lowest-occurrence Zone = FAD of 'Paragloborotalia' pseudokugleri to FAD of 'Paragloborotalia' kugleri.
	O6	26.93		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P22' (and 'N3').  O6 zone Globigerina ciperoensis Partial-range Zone is the lower part of the former O6 [was 'Globigerina ciperoensis Partial Range Subzone'] = (LAD of Parabloborotalia opima opima to FAD of Globorotalia kugleri) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.
	O5	28.09		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P21b' [= Zone O5 of Beggren-Pearson '05)] is Paragloborotalia opima Highest-occurrence Zone [was 'Globigerina angulisuturalis -Paragloborotalia opima opima Interval Subzone'] = (LAD/LCO of Chiloguembelina cubensis to LAD of Para. opima) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  The base is at LAD of 'Chiloguembelina cubensis' (Berggren & Miller, 1988), however, Berggren (1995, SEPM) indicates the zonal boundary at "last common occurrence"(which he calls the "virtual LAD" instead of extinction of this taxon.
	O4	29.18		Oligocene Foram Zone P21 is the Globigerina angulisuturalis/Paragloborotalia opima opima Concurrent Range Zone (Blow, 1969; Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD to LAD, and is subdivided into 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P21a' (= Zone O4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is defined as the 'Globigerina angulisuturalis / Chiloguembelina cubensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of G. angul. to LAD of Chil. cubensis) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).
	O3	30.28		Oligocene Foram Zone "P20" (= Zone O3 of Berggren-Pearson '05) (and "N1") is defined as the 'Globigerina sellii Partial Range Zone' (LAD of '"T." ampliaperatura' to FAD of 'Globigerina angulisuturalis') by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.
	O2	32.1		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P19' (= Zone O2 of Berggren-Pearson '04) is defined as the "'Turborotalia' ampliapertura Interval Zone' (LAD of Pseudohastigerina spp. to LAD of 'T.' ampliapertura) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  "The historical vicissitudes associated with this zone" are discussed in Berggren & MIller (1988). 
	O1	33.89		Oligocene Foram Zone 01 = Pseudohastigerina naguewichiensis Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Hantkenina alabamensis and LAD of Pseudohastigerina naguewichiensis.
	E16	34.61		Eocene Foram Zone E16 = Hantkenina alabamensis Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Globigerinatheka index to LAD of Hantkenina alabamensis
	E15	36.18		Eocene Foram Zone E15 = Globigerinatheka index Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta to LAD of Globigerinatheka index
	E14	38.25		Eocene Foram Zone E14 = Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Morozovella crassata to LAD of Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta
	E13	40.03		Eocene Foram Zone E13 = Morozovelloides crassatus Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Orbulinoides beckmanni to LAD of Morozovella crassata.    Eocene Foram Zone P14 (nearly same as E13 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Truncorotaloides rohri -Morozovella spinulosa Partial Range Zone') = LAD of G. beckmanni to FAD of P. semiinvoluta (Berggren and Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.
	E12	40.49		Eocene Foram Zone P13 (= Zone E12) of Berggren-Pearson '05) Orbulinoides beckmanni Taxon-range Zone [was called the 'Globigerapsis (now Orbulinoides) beckmanni Total Range Zone'] = FAD to LAD of name species (Bolli, 1957; Berggren et al., 1995).
	E11	42.07	dashed	Eocene Foram Zone E11 = Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Guembelitrioides nuttalli to FAD of Orbulinoides beckmanni = essentially a "gap" zone.  DASHED (poor age control)
	E10	43.26		Eocene Foram Zone P12 is the 'Morozovella lehneri Partial Range Zone' (LAD of M. aragonensis to FAD of G. beckmanni) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.
	E9	43.88		DASHED (poor magstrat control).  Eocene Foram Zone P11 (= Zone E9 of Berggren-Pearson '05 = ) is the Globigerinatheka kugleri / Morozovella aragonensis Concurrent-range Zone (FAD to LAD) (Berggren, 1969, but with complicated history; see redefinition in Berggren et al., 1995).
	E8	45.72		Eocene Foram Zone E8 has a complex history of redefinition and revised datum-chron calibrations.  E8 of Wade et al'11 clarifies what was previously considered coeval "base events", which are now known to diverge => use FAD of Guembelitrioides nuttalli.  The previous Eocene Foram Zone P10 (= essentially E8 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is EITHER the 'G. nuttalli zone (beginning at FAD) or the 'Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to the FAD of 'Globigerapsis kugleri') (Berggren & Miller, 1988; = Hankenina aragonensis Zone of Bolli, 1957).  Rather confusing!  FAD of G. nuttalli (which is NOT the same as Hantkenina nuttalli) is NOW dashed at approximately C21n.8  (Lutetian GSSP publication, Episodes 2011) and is suggested as alternate (base of E8) zonal datum by Berggren and Pearson (2005).   This is nearly 3 million years higher than in Berggren-Pearson!  Wade et al'11 summarize: "In a detailed magnetobiostratigraphic study of an expanded lower-middle Eocene succession from the western Pyrenees, Payros et al. (2007) examined the divergence of planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 and the standard zonation (BKSA95). Unlike BKSA95 which places the boundary between planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 within calcareous nannofossil Zone NP14 (Subzone CP12a) and magnetic polarity Chron C22n/C21r boundary, they found the boundary to occur within Zone NP15 (=Zone CP13) and Chron C20r.  ... The P9/P10 zonal boundary is therefore a surprising 3.1 myr younger than in BKSA95."  AND, the First occurrence of Hantkenina (other base of P10) which was a working definition of base of Lutetian Stage but later found to be significantly higher (may be nearly top of C20r -- maybe 2 myr higher still!).  Calibration of these events needs further careful study.  
	E7	50.2		Eocene Foram Zone E7 = Acarinina cuneicamerata Lowest-occurrence Zone of Wade et al'11 = now defined as FAD of Acarinina cuneicamerata to the FAD of Guembelitrioides nuttalli.  This follows an "alternative" of Berggren-Pearson '05, who  had also used a top of FAD of Hantkenina nuttalii  Eocene Foram Zone P9 is the 'Planorotalites palmerae -Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to FAD) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Lower Subzone E7a is to the FAD of Turborotalia frontosa.
	E6	50.67		Eocene Foram Zone E6 = Acarinina pentacamerata Partial-range Zone = gap between LAD of M. subbotinae to FAD of A.  pentacamerata.  Eocene Foram Zone P8 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05).  Eocene Foram Zone P8 is the Morozovella aragonensis Partial Range Zone = 'gap' between LAD of Moro. subbotinae (was M. formosa) to FAD of Planorotalites palmerae (Berggren & Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  However, Aubrey et al. (1988, with Berggren as a co-author), places base of P8 at "FAD of Acarinina pentacamerata", and draws this boundary "approximately midway between the boundaries of Zones P6/P7 and P8/P9" (p. 735).  The simultaneous publication of conflicting definitions for base of Zone P8 (both with Berggren as an author, and neither discussing the change) was confusing until Wade et al'11 clarified.
	E5	52.54		Eocene Foram Zone E5 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella aragonensis / Morozovella subbotinae Concurrent-range Zone (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. subbotinae.  Eocene Foram Zone P7 is the 'Morozovella aragonensis/Morozovella formosa formosa Concurrent Range Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. formosa
	E4	54.61		Eocene Foram Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella formosa Lowest-occurrence Zone = FAD of Moro. formosa to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.   Subzone "P6b" of Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6c" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella formosa formosa/Morozovella lensiformis -Morozovella aragonensis Interval SubZone"; and from simultaneous FAD of Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Moro. lensiformis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.
	E3	55.2		DASH (uncertain placement within chron) (but Wade requested J.Ogg to remove "dash" via e-mail 18July2011) -- .  Eocene Foram Zone E3 Morozovella marginodentata Partial-range Zone = gap between LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. formosa.   Eocene Foram Zone P6 is the Morozovella subbotinae Partial Range Zone (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995) = "gap" from LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.  The P5/6a boundary was used in some publications to approx. Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  Near-basal Eocene Foram SubZone "P6a" of new Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6b" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name was "Morozovella velascoensis -Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Morozovella lensiformis Interval SubZone".  Note that this is a "gap" zone between LAD of 'M. velasoensis' and FAD of 'M. formosa formosa/lensiformis'.
	E2	55.81		Zone E1 and E2 of Berggren-Pearson '05 is attempt to find some events at P/E thermal excursion.  However, the marker species for base of E1 and E2 are rarely noted in previous studies; therefore, usage of these zones may be limited.
	E1	55.96		Zone E1 and E2 of Berggren-Pearson '05 is attempt to find some events at P/E thermal excursion.  However, the marker species for base of E1 and E2 are rarely noted in previous studies; therefore, usage of these zones may be limited.
	P5	57.1		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P5', as defined by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM) is the 'Morozovella velascoensis Interval Zone' = LAD of Glob. pseudomenardii to LAD of Moro. velascoensis.  This definition of P5 encompasses the former P5 and P6a zones of Berggren and Miller (1988).
	P4	60.73		Paleocene Foram Zone P4 --  Revised version of Berggren-Pearson = Globanomalina pseudomenardii / Parasubbotina variospira Concurrent-range Subzone is to FAD of Parasubbotina variospira.  Former Foram Zone P4 (Berggren et al'95 usage) was the Globanomalina pseudomenardii Total Range Zone  (Bolli, 1957a).  Paleocene Foram Zone 'P4' was subdivided by the LAD of 'Acar. subsphaerica' and FAD of 'Acar. soldadoensis' by Berggren et al. (1995) to essentially correspond to foraminifer zones used in the Caucasus; but was re-subzoned by Wade et al. (2011).
	P3	62.29		Paleocene Foram Zone P3 Morozovella angulata Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the Morozovella angulata-Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone] = FAD of P. angulata to FAD of G. pseudomenardii (defined in Berggren et al., 1995, revised in Wade et al'11; emend. of P3 of Berggren and Miller, 1988) with 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P3a' is the 'Morozovella angulata -Muricella albeari Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995).  An earlier version of subzone P3a used the FAD of Igorina pusilla top define the top of subzone, but this FAD is rare and reported to occur at the base of P3 (Berggren et al., 1995).  A working base of the Selandian substage (top of Danian) is the P2/P3 boundary (Berggren et al., 1995).
	P2	62.6		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P2' Praemurica uncinata Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the 'Praemurica uncinata -Morozovella angulata Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995)] = FAD of P. uncinata to FAD of M. angulata;  equivalent to the same zone of Berggren and Miller (1988).  In general, this brief zone only encompasses 2-3 m in deep sea sites.
	P1	65.72		Paleocene Foram Zone P1 is the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina-Praemurica uncinata Interval Zone (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of Berggren and Miller, 1988) = gap from LAD of P. eugubina to FAD of P. uncinata.  Subzone 'P1a' is the 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina - Subbotina triloculinoides Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995), which is an emendation of the former P1a 'Parasubbotina pseudobulloides' subzone of Berggren & Miller (1988), but the range is essentially identical.  Note that both are a "gap" zone (LAD of eugubina to FAD of another marker).
	Pa	66		Paleocene Foraminifer Zone P-alpha is the Total Range Zone of "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina"   [Liu, (1993) emendation of Blow's (1979) "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Partial-range Zone"; in turn from Luterbacher & Premoli Silva's (1964) "Globigerina eugubina Zone"; however, Smit (1982) uses "G. eugubina Zone" as "P1a"].  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).
	P0	66.04		Basal Paleocene Planktonic Foraminifer Zone P0 (= Guembelitria cretacea, Partial range zone) is from Keller (1988; emendation of Smit, 1982).  Gap between Base = extinction of Rugoglobigerina, Globotruncana, Globotruncanella and associated taxa.  Top = FAD of P. eugubina.  See Berggren et al. (SEPM, 1995) for a page discussing the P0, P-alpha, P1 definition history and problems.  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).
	Plummerita hantkeninoides	66.39		Brian Huber (written comm., Sept 2011): "Add Plummerita hantkeninoides zone with dashed base at top Maastrichtian using Li and Keller, 1998 age (about 350 kyr below K/Pg)".  Assumed that this is marked by LAD of A. mayaroensis, which SEPM'98 had assigned as ~0.3 m.y. before K/T
	Pseudoguembelina hariaensis	67.3		Pseudoguembelina hariaensis Zone (FAD of species) of Caron'95 recommended by Huber et al'08.  Base is mid-Chron 30n (DASHED at 66.78 Ma by Huber et al'08 => C30n.5.
	Abathomphalus mayaroensis	69.18		A. mayaroensis zone begins at base of Chron C31n (summarized by Huber et al'08; and their corrected age of 68.66 => C31n.1).  GTS04 had used a slightly higher Chron C31n.40 (ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995).  This is the Tethyan FAD.  The FAD of A. mayaroensis seems to be older in North Sea (Paul Sikora, EGI database, 2005).  SEPM'98 correlation was approx. top of J. nebrascansis ammonite zone.
	Racemiguembelina fructicosa	70.14	dashed	DASHED (diachronous):  Upper third of Chron C31r (Huber et al'08; who interpolate age of 69.62 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics => C31r.6).This is same as Chron C31r.60  in ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995; which is nearly same as the C31r.66 placement in SEPM98).  NOTE: However, this FAD in Tethyan realm is calibrated in EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) as 67.5 Ma (2 myr young), which is ABOVE the FAD of A. mayaroensis => this Zone may not be applicable.  "Latitudinal diachroneity" (later FAD in Chron C31n at DSDP 525; Li and Keller, 1998) cited by Huber et al'08.  
	Pseudoguembelina palpebra	71.75		P. palpebra zone added by Huber et al'08 "because recognition of the G. gansseri and G. aegyptiaca zones is deemed unreliable (at least at Leg 207 Blake Nose sites).  Base is "upper Chron C32n.1r" (Brian Huber, written commun., Sept 11) -- used here as C32n.1r.75 and FAD of Nannofossil T. phacelosus (base of CC24, in their version), although their projected 71.64 Ma "relative to GTS04 magnetics" implies C32n.2n.9 which is 0.3 myr lower.  This useful datum is tabulated in EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005), with age derived from composite standard (1998 time scale) -- their implied age is 72% up in Chron C32n.2n.
	Gansserina gansseri	72.97	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 (and SEPM'98) places at Chron C32n.2n.40; following Premoli and Sliter (1994); and Brian Huber advised to dash it.
	Globotruncana aegyptiaca	74	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 (and SEPM'98) places at Chron C32r.1n.50 according to their interpolation (73.27 Ma, relative to GTS04 magnetics), although their text says "C32r.2r.5.  However, EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) calibrates Glob. aegyptiaca FAD at 72.7 Ma; about 0.5 myr younger.
	Globotruncanella havanensis	75.71		Calcarata was previously assigned to genus Globotruncanita.  DASH -- SEPM'98 places at Chron C33n.85 (74.47 Ma on GTS04 magnetics); but Huber et al'08 assign as 75.57 Ma relative to those magnetics (which would be C33n.75; although their text says C32n.92).
	Radotruncana calcarata	76.18		Calcarata was previously assigned to genus Globotruncanita.  Polarity chron C33n.66 (Huber et al'08 although text accidentally says "C33n.76"; SEPM).  Genus assigned as "Radotruncana" in Leg 171B table, but not in their Figure.
	Contusotruncana plummerae	79.2		Zone of C. plummerae replaced G. ventricosa (due to rarity of that basal marker) by Petrizzo et al., 2011.  Calbrated as 78.8 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics by them, hence C33n.125 (1/8th up in Zone).  Formerly called Globotruncana fornicata Plummer subsp. plummerae.
	Globotruncanita elevata	83.64		Coeval with base of C33r.  Top of Santonian in SEPM'98; but this is circular if the debate is whether to use this LAD as a major marker for defining base-Cenomanian.
	Dicarinella asymetrica	86.66	dashed	DASHED -- D. asymtrica Zone is also range-zone of the index species. Current base-Santonian GSSP proposal (Spanish section) implies that this level would be in upper Coniacian.  Coniacian-Santonian boundary interval section of Ten Mile Creek (Gale et al., 2007) suggest ca. 75% up in S. depressus Ammonite Zone or lower.  In contrast, SEPM'98 assigns as Base of Middle Santonian (= base C. vermiformis ammonite zone). 
	Dicarinella concavata	91.08	dashed	Dashed -- One-third up in P. hyatti ammonite zone in SEPM98 (hence about 2 myr below base-Coniacian); but ODP Leg 171B placed about 0.8 myr higher (used here, on advice of Brian Huber, written comm., Sept 11), therefore shifted to Base of S. ferronensis ammonite zone,
	Marginotruncana schneegansi	92.99		For now, LAD of H. helvetica assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone to put coeval with FAD of nanno E. eximius.  But that nanno FAD might be diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (it is above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.).  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.  Base of  P. percarinatus ammonite zone on SEPM'98 chart; which is about 0.6 myr younger.
	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	93.52	dashed	DASH (Petrizzo advises this).  Base of H. helvetica is just above top of W. devonense ammonite zone (UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011); so put as 1/3rd up in P. flexuosum zone here.  SEPM 98 had equivalent to the Top of W. devonense ammonite zone (= base of P. flexuosum ammonite zone) on SEPM'98 chart.
	Whiteinella archaeocretacea	94.3	dashed	DASH -- Not well calibrated, because top at Gubbio is preservation and Morocco suggests diachronous (Petrizzo; at UCL nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  SEPM'98 places arbitrary (?) at 0.4 myr before top of Cenomanian (= top of Rotalipora genus?) -- used here.  Caron (1985) indicates base of this zone as FAD of W. archaeocretacea, rather than LAD of R. cushmani; and  this FAD is ~0.6 myr below.
	Rotalipora cushmani	95.94		SEPM'98 places at mid-point of Acanthoceras muldoonense ammonite zone. See note on R. reicheli.
	Thalmanninella reicheli	96.08		Formerly called "Rotalipora reicheli".  SEPM'98 assigns as base of Middle Cenomanian.   Leg 171B table assigns the R. reicheli Zone with an age ~1 myr older, but with same duration.
	Thalmanninella globotruncanoides	100.5		Formerly "Rotalipora globotruncanoides".  Base of Cenomanian (= primary marker of GSSP !! ).  Formerly called "R. greenhornensis"?  SEPM'98 had assigned as latest Albian (mid-point of uppermost subzone, M. perinflatum), but this was prior to GSSP definition of boundary.
	Parathalmanninella appenninica	101.92		Formerly "Rotalipora appenninica".  Base of planktonic foraminifer Rotalipora appenninica is nearly the same horizon as base of Planomalina buxtorfi = base of that zone = 3.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (1.3 myr) => 100.9 Ma.  Leckie et al. (2002) indicate that R. appenninica FAD is just slightly older/below the FAD of P. buxtorfi, but Hardenbol et al. (1998) and Bellier et al., (2000) show the events to be simultaneous, which I will assume here.  The duration is 1.3 myr, nearly identical to the 1.5 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002) and 1.1 myr in Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Considering the thickness at Risou for this R. appenninica zone (in excess of 100 m; Kennedy et al., 2003 in press), I would have preferred a much longer time span.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Stoliczkaia dispar Zone.
	Pseudothalmanninella ticinensis	103.94		Formerly "Rotalipora ticinensis".  Base of zone = 8.5 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (3.3 myr) on Piobbico and Col de Palleul cyclostratigraphy (Grippo et al., 2004; Gale et al., 2011) => 102.9 Ma.   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/5 from base of H. varicosum s.z.
	Pseudothalmanninella subticinensis	106.98	dashed	Formerly "Rotalipora subticinensis".  DASH:  SEPM'98 had assigned as FAD is at the base of the H. orbignyi s.z. of the M. (M.) inflatum. (used here).   Base of foraminifer R. subticinensis (base of that subzone) is not indicated in this Piobbico cyclostratigraphy, but Leckie et al. (2002) scales it within the B. breggiensis zone as 0.7 myr below the base of R. ticinensis, which would project as 103.6 Ma in GTS04, but would lose the relative proportions of Leckie's scale.
	Ticinella praeticinensis	107.39		Base of T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone  = 17 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (6.8 myr) => 106.4 Ma.  The duration is 3.2 myr, nearly the same as the 3.3 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002).  (NOTE -- Leckie et al., 2002, define the T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone as the base of B. breggiensis Zone, in turn defined by the base of that species; however, the actual FAD of T. praeticinensis is below/older than the base of B. breggiensis according to both Leckie et al., 2002, and Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Because Premoli Silva is a co-author on both the Leckie et al., 2002 paper and on the Piobbico cycle stratigraphy paper, I'm assuming that the T. praeticinensis subzone is defined as base of B. breggiensis for this scaling.  In contrast, the zonal schemes of Hardenbol et al., 1998, and Bellier et al., 2000, do not have a B. breggiensis zone, but define the base of T. praeticinensis zone by the first occurrence of the name species.  What a mess.)  (primary control on Albian scale!)
	Ticinella primula	111.84		Base of foraminifer T. primula is 28 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (11.3 myr) in Piobbico cyclestrat => 110.9 Ma.  The T. primula zone extends up to 106.4 Ma, which is consistent with the 107.1 Ma Ar-Ar age within it (but from the middle of the 3 ammonite zones that it spans) obtained by Obradovich (1993).   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had placed in middle of O. raulinianus s.z.
	Ticinella madecassiana	112.4	dotted	New zone replacing upper H.planispira (Huber-Leckie'11).  DOTTED at middle of former zone.
	Microhedbergella rischi	112.96	dashed	Could be a definition for the base-Albian (easy to recognize).  Huber-Leckie's estimated 300 kyr interval above LAD of P. eubejaouaensis (used here); but Huber (pers. comm., Sept 2011) implied that it should be shorter.  "accompanied, within a short stratigraphic thickness, by the extinction of several other Aptian hedbergellids, including Hd. infracretacea, Hd. occulta, Hd. gorbachikae, and Hd. excelsa, as well as Gl. aptiensis. Species diversity is very low," (Huber-Leckie, 2011)
	Microhedbergella renilaevis	113.14		Middle of Kilian level (hence, about 31.1 cycles below base-Cenomanian).  Mi renilaevis co-occurs with common Mi. miniglobularis at ODP-DSDP sites in S. Atlantic, North Atlantic and Indian Ocean; therefore is an important marker.
	Microhedbergella miniglobularis	113.26		Base of former H. planispira foraminifer zone (assumed "LAD" of T. bejaouaensis" definition is used by them?) is 31.5 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (Huang et al, 2010) at Piobbico.  Brian Huber (to J.Ogg; 15Aug11 "Note that there is no longer a planispira zone because true planispira did not evolve until the late Albian!")  Calibrations of other authors are inconsistent -- the base of the H. planispira Zone is placed ABOVE base of P. columnata in Leckie et al. (2002), middle of H.jacobi ammonite zone of Late Aptian (Herle et al., 2004) and much higher as the middle of Lower Albian by Bellier et al. (2000) -- and other assignments are briefly reviewed in Petrizzo et al. (Newsletters of Stratigraphy; in press 2011).  However, Hardenbol et al. (1998) place the FAD of H. planispira below the FAD of P. columnata, as is indicated at Piobbico and at the reference sections in SE France; thereforehad assigned as 50% up in H. jacobi Zone. 
	Paraticinella eubejaouaensis	118.02		Base (formerly called Ticinella bejaouaensis) = 43 1/4 cycles (of 405 kyr) at Piobbico cycle strat (Huang et al., 2010).  In GTS04 was 114.6 Ma (was 114.3 in Leckie's chart) [but table now has 114.3].  SEPM'98 had estimated as 3/5 up in D. nodosocostatum s.z.
	Hedbergella infracretacea	118.93		GAP ZONE -- Top G. algerianus (= base of Hedbergella trocoidea, H. gorbachikae, or Planomalina cheniourensis Zone, depending on author; which is essentially a "gap" zone) = 45.5 cycles of 405kyr below base-Cenomanian at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2011).  Brian Huber (to J.Ogg; 15Aug11 - "I now prefer using the Hedbergella infracretacea Zone since that species is so widespread and present within that stratigraphic interval."   GTS04 = 116.0 Ma  (was 115.2 in Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 m.y. before top of nufieldiensis Zone.   "gap zone" (LAD at base; FAD at top).  Not included in all foraminifer zonations.
	Globigerinelloides algerianus	122.17		Base Globigerinelloides algerianus = 53.5 cycles of 0.405 below base-Cenomaniann at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 119.0 Ma (was 117.1 on Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 3/5 from base of martinoides Zone.
	Globigerinelloides ferreolensis	122.98		Top L. cabri (= base of G. ferreolensis zone) = 55.5 cycles of 405 kyr below base-Cenomanian in Piobbico core (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 120.7 Ma (was 118.2 in Leckie's table).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 1/5 from base of martinoides Zone. 
	L. cabri (consistent)	123.89	dotted	Consistent L. cabri (and calibration of FAD in SE France, etc.) is 57.75 cycles of 405kyr below base-Cenomanian at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 85% up in D. deshayesi Zone (but see comment below -- rare occurrences are nearly to base of Aptian).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/3 from base of Deshayesites deshayesi Zone.
	Leupoldina cabri	125.71	dotted	Base L. cabri (after downward extension by Premoli Silva et al., 1999) = rare L.cabri = 62.25 cycles of 405kyr below base of Cenomanian at Piobbico (just below base of Selli OAE1a) (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 0.5 myr above base Aptian (125.0 Ma) = 124.5 Ma  (but, usually rare until higher; therefore the apparent FAD of L. cabri in the middle of the D. deshayesi ammonite zone in the Bedoule section (Moullade et al., 1998) is probably this delayed first occurrence).
	Globigerinelloides blowi	128.73		SEPM'98 had assigned as Estimated as about 1/4 below top of A. vandenheckii zone.
	Hedbergella similis	130.37		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of N. nicklesi Zone.
	Hedbergella sigali/delrioensis	134.22		SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 myr above mid-H. trinodosum s.z.   Most scales list this as H. sigali Foram Zone.
	Globuligerina hoterivica	141.93		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of M. paraminounum s.z.   Also called "Favusella" hoterivica
	Conoglobigerina gulekhensis	145.95		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Berriasian





Sub-Tropical subzone	block	30	247/249/153	notitle	off	Sub-Tropical SubZones from Wade et al., 2011
	TOP	0
	b	0.61		Subzone "Pt1b" is the 'Globorotalia truncatulinoides Partial Range SubZone' (LAD of Glob. toasaensis to present) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is equivalent to the upper part of Zone N23 of Blow (1979).
	a	1.88		Pleistocene Foram Zone Pt1 is the Globigerinoides ruber Partial-range Zone (formerly Globigerinoides fistulosus-Globorotalia truncatulinoides Interval Zone) = LAD of G. fistulosus to Present, and characterized by G. truncatulinoides (Berggren et al., SEPM, 1995).   Pleistocene Foram SubZone "Pt1a" is theGloborotalia tosaensis Highest-occurrence Subzone (formerly 'Globigerinoides fistulosus -Globorotalia tosaensis Interval SubZone') (LAD of Glob. fistulosus to LAD of Glob. tosaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This may be equivalent to the lower part of Zone N23 of Blow (1979); however, the base of N23 boundary is FAD of Globigerina calida calida & Sph. excavata (Blow, 1969), but these datums are not in Beggren's compilations (1985 or 1995).  However, this event probably is just below the LAD of G. fistulosus (Intro. notes to ODP Leg 138 volume, p.28 - Table 6).
	TOP	6.14		Miocene foram 'Globorotalia lenguaensis' LAD defines top of M13 [but see NOTE for Zone M14 and Subzone M13b].  Pacific calibration: Same scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a) - LAD is directly calibrated to C3An.1n in ODP Hole 840 (Tonga Platform, SW Pacific) and Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau, equatorial West Pacific).  This LAD occurs just below FAD of P. primalis at ODP 840 and just above it at ODP 806B.  The corresponding age is about 6.0 Ma (Cande & Kent, 1995). Chron-age assignment = C3An.1n at 6.0 Ma = C3An.1n.5. Atlantic calibration: Astronomically tuned in South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 (8.97 Ma in Lourens et al. 2004). In Hole 519 (S. Atl.), calibrated to upper C4An (about 8.7 Ma) in Poore et al. (1983).  In E68-136 (Gulf of Mexico), the LAD occurs about 10m above the FAD of Globorotalia plesiotumida (=base of N17) and within range of Minylitha convallis and above the LAD of Discoaster bollii.  In contrast, in E66-73, the LAD is at the same level as FAD of G. plesiotumida (8.58 Ma), and below the FAD of M. convallis and LAD of D. bollii (Zhang et al., 1993; Aubry, 1993). Following Turco et al. (2002), Lourens et al. (2004) significantly revised the LAD of G. lenguaensis to 8.97 Ma. This revised age is significantly older than reported in Berggren et al. (1995a) (derived from the Tonga Plateau, SW Pacific). This revision, Wade et al. (2011) argued would place this event within the M13a Subzone, "inconsistent with the established order of bioevents". In the Gulf of Mexico, however, Zhang et al. (1993) found the Top of G. lenguaensis near the same horizon as the Top G. plesiotumida (8.52 Ma; Table 1), more consistent with the older age suggested by Turco et al. (2002). Wade et al. (2011) argued that they retained the Berggren et al. (1995) age for stability, pending further investigation. In contrast to Wade et al. (2011), this study chooses to honor both calibrations and recognizes significant diachrony between the Atlantic and Pacific ages of LAD of G. lenguaensis. The Atlantic event is herein no longer used as a zonal marker between M13b and M14 and the resulting zone in the Atlantic scheme is therefore a M14-M13b composite, pending further investigation.
	b	8.58		M13b base (base of N17) defined by:  FAD of Glob. plesiotumida (formerly also eval FAD of Neo. humerosa).  [NOTE:  In contrast to Wade et al. (2011), Erik Anthonissen choose to honor both the Atlantic andPacific calibrations and recognizes significant diachrony for the LAD of G. lenguaensis. The Atlantic event is no longer used by him as a zonal marker between M13b and M14 and the resulting zone in the Atlantic scheme is therefore a M14-M13b composite, pending further investigation.]]  The Globorotalia plesiotumida/Globorotalia lenguaensis Concurrent-range Subzone [fomerly)'Globigerinoides extremus/Globorotalia plesiotumida -Globorotalia lenguaensis Interval SubZone' (FAD of Globig. extremus/ Globorot.plesiotumida to LAD of Globorotalia lenguaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995)],  is equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N17' of Blow (1969).  M13b base defined either by:  Glob. plesiotumida or Neo. humerosa. The base of "N17" was defined as the initial evolutionary FAD of Gt. Plesiotumida from its (putative) ancestor Gt. merotumida, but this event is difficult to apply.  The base of "N17" was defined as the initial evolutionary FAD of Gt.

Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta' FAD is based on revised interpretation of magnetostratigraphy of Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies in ref.o = C5An.2n; 12.3 Ma = C5An.2n.5.

Base is same as base of N12 of Blow (1969, 1979), and top is probably near mid-N13.  Magnetochronologic calibration of boundaries is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy in DSDP Hole 563 by Wright and Miller (1992).  Two subzones -- Miocene Foram SubZone "M9a" Fohsella fohsi Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was the 'Globorotalia fohsi lobata Lineage SubZone'] is equivalent to "old" (initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata to evolutionary FAD of its descendent Globorotalia fohsi robusta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to lower portion of Zone 'N12' of Blow (1979).  Miocene Foram Zone "M8" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str. Lineage Zone' ( initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi s.str. to initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N11' of Blow (1979).  However, species "lobata" apparently combined with Fohsella "fohsi" in zonal scheme of Lourens et al. (in GTS2004).  This effectively removed the thin "M8" of Berggren et al., 1995.

Two subzones:  VERY SHORT Miocene Foram Zone "M5a" is Praeorbulina sicana Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was 'Praeorbulina sicana -Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. Interval Subzone'] = (FAD of Praeorbulina sicana to FAD of Pr. glomerosa sensu stricto) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This short subzone spans the lowermost part of the 'N8' zone.  The base of this zone is used to denote the base of the Langhian Substage (base of Middle Miocene), although this boundary may be more closely associated with the slightly younger FAD of Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. (base of Subzone 'M5b'), which would render this substage about 0.3 myr shorter in duration.

Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone of 1 myr.  Miocene Foram Zone "M4a" is 'Catapsydrax dissimilis -Globorotalia birnageae Interval SubZone" (LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus to FAD of Globorotalia birnageae) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This subzone spans the lower part of the 'N7' zone.

Miocene Foram Zone "M1a" is 'Paragloborotalia' kugleri Lowest-occurrence Subzone = (FAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globoquadrina dehiscens) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is approximately coeval to the 'N4a' subzone of Srinivasan & Kennett (1981); but -- Wade (email Oct'11 to J.Ogg) "Base of N4 and M1 are not the same. Zone M1 defined by base Paragloborotalia kugleri.   Zone N4 (as per Kennett and Srinivasan, 1983) defined by base common occurrence of Globigerinoides primordius = 23.6 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004).
	TOP	45.72		FAD of G. nuttalli (which is NOT the same as Hantkenina nuttalli) is dashed at approximately the base of Chron C21r (or may be ca. 0.2 myr lower at C21n.9 or C21n.8, if use the Lutetian GSSP publication in Episodes, 2011, based on Payros et al., 2009) and is the base of revised zone E8 (Wade et al., 2011).  This datum-chron correlation is nearly 3 million years higher than in Berggren & Pearson (2005).  Wade et al. (2011) summarize: "In a detailed magnetobiostratigraphic study of an expanded lower-middle Eocene succession from the western Pyrenees, Payros et al. (2009) examined the divergence of planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 and the standard zonation (BKSA95). Unlike BKSA95 which places the boundary between planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 within calcareous nannofossil Zone NP14 (Subzone CP12a) and magnetic polarity Chron C22n/C21r boundary, they found the boundary to occur within Zone NP15 (=Zone CP13) and Chron C20r.  ... The P9/P10 zonal boundary is therefore a surprising 3.1 myr younger than in BKSA95."  In addition, the first occurrence of Hantkenina (alternate suggested marker for base of P10), which had been a working definition of base of Lutetian Stage, was found to be significantly higher (possibly near the top of Chron C20r; ca. another 2 myr higher).  Calibration of these events needs further careful study.   [In contrast, the age assignment of these events, hence base-Lutetian, by Berggren and Pearson (2005) was 49.0 Ma = Base C21r.]
	b	48.31		T. frontosa FAD (Base of Zone E7b) is "one of most signficant foraminifer events in Middle/Early Eocene boundary interval; and occurs 13 precession cycles (0.26 myr) above base of C21r at the Lutetian GSSP section (Lutetian GSSP; published in Episodes, 2011).  [Wade et al. (2011) table has an age of 48.6 Ma; but this would project only the base of that Chron C21r on their polarity time scale.]

	TOP	57.1		LAD defines top of Zone P4.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) have similar chron-age calibration (base of Chron C24r) as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii' was called "Planorotallites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).  The LAD (= base Zone P5) is recorded in North Pacific Shatsky Rise Hole 577 at either base of polarity chron C24r (Corfield, 1987) and or top C25n (Liu & Olsson pers comm., 1993) and in Indian Ocean Hole 752 at top C25n (Pospichal et al., 1991).  Juxtaposition/overlap of Gl. pseudomenardii LAD and Gt. subbotinae FAD is observed in Holes 465 and 758 (Nederbragt & van Hinte, 1987).  [Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii' was called "Planorotallites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).]
	c	57.79		Foram SubZone 'P4c' is defined as the 'Acarinina soldadoensis -Globanomalina pseudomenardii Concurrent range Zone' by Berggren et al. (1995) = FAD of Acarinina soldadoensis to LAD of Globanomalina pseudomenardii.
	b	60.52		Acarinina subsphaerica Partial-range Subzone = gap between LAD of P. variospira to FAD of A. coldadoensis.  This is NEW version of SubZone P4b (Berggren et al, 2000).  Previously, Berggren et al. (1995) version of Paleocene Foram Subzone 'P4b' had been defined as the 'Acarinina subsphaerica -Acarinina soldadoensis Interval Zone' -- 'gap' between LAD of 'Acar. subsphaerica' and FAD of 'Acar. soldadoensis'.
	a	60.73		Paleocene Foram Zone P4 --  Revised version of Berggren-Pearson = Globanomalina pseudomenardii / Parasubbotina variospira Concurrent-range Subzone is to FAD of Parasubbotina variospira.  Former Foram Zone P4 (Berggren et al'95 usage) was the Globanomalina pseudomenardii Total Range Zone  (Bolli, 1957a).  Paleocene Foram Zone 'P4' was subdivided by the LAD of 'Acar. subsphaerica' and FAD of 'Acar. soldadoensis' by Berggren et al. (1995) to essentially correspond to foraminifer zones used in the Caucasus; but was re-subzoned by Wade et al. (2011).
	b	61.33		Paleocene Foram Zone P3b Igorina albeari Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was the 'Muricella albeari -Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995)] = FAD of I. albeari (=Muricella albeari = Globorotalia laevigata !) to FAD of Globanomalina pseudomenardii.  Complex history -- Paleocene foram 'Igorina albeari  FAD defines the base of Zone P3b of Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is NOT the P3b of Berggren & Miller (1988) defined by FAD of Igorina pusilla.  Paleocene Foram SubZone P3b was defined as FAD of 'Igorina pusilla' ('Muricella pusilla' in Berggren et al., 1995) in Berggren & Miller (1988).  However, 'Mur. pusilla' has been observed to occur with the FAD of 'Moro. angulata' (base of SubZone P3a), therefore Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM) redefined the SubZone P3b as the FAD of Muricella albeari, which is about 1 myr higher.
	a	62.29		Paleocene Foram Zone P3 Morozovella angulata Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the Morozovella angulata-Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone] = FAD of P. angulata to FAD of G. pseudomenardii (defined in Berggren et al., 1995, revised in Wade et al'11; emend. of P3 of Berggren and Miller, 1988) with 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P3a' is the 'Morozovella angulata -Muricella albeari Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995).  An earlier version of subzone P3a used the FAD of Igorina pusilla top define the top of subzone, but this FAD is rare and reported to occur at the base of P3 (Berggren et al., 1995).  A working base of the Selandian substage (top of Danian) is the P2/P3 boundary (Berggren et al., 1995).
	TOP	62.6		Praemurica uncinata' (formerly 'Morozovella uncinata') FAD defines base of Zone P2.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) moved the FAD 0.4 myr older than in Berggren et al. (1995), who had an extended discussion of calibration problems in different sites.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) summary age assignment of 61.37 Ma corresponds to Chron C27r.92 on their polarity scale.   [NOTES from Berggren et al. (1995) -- The FAD occurs in Hole 577 (refs. a,e) just above a N->R polarity reversal (= polarity chron C28n); but Polarity chron C27n is missing (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86: p.446, Fig. 5; p.449, Fig 7B), and there may be a short hiatus at/near the level if FAD of this taxon in C27n (ref. b) is correct.  Alternatively C27n may be missing in the core break between cores 11 and 12 (ca. 101.8 m) in which case the FO of this taxon would be near the C27r/C28n boundary (see ref. b).  In Hole 384, it occurs at the same level as FAD of 'P. praeangulata' in Nannofossil Zone NP4 at the base of C27n, as well as in Holes 465 and 758A (see extended discussion in Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).  Its FAD was considered equivalent to FAD of 'Praemurica praecursoria' (= 'Globorotalia (Acarinina) praecursoria' of Berggren & Miller, 1988) in an earlier draft by Berggren (1993), but 'praecursoria' was removed from his later versions. Chron assignment = C27n (lower); 61.2 Ma [a,b]; but 61.37 Ma (uppermost C27r) in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C27r.92.]
	c	63.9		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P1c' Globanomalina compressa Lowest-occurrence Subzone = FAD of G. compressa to FAD of P. uncinata.  [Was the 'Globanomalina compressa/Praemurica inconstans -Praemurica uncinata Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al., 1995) with a base defined by the FAD of either 'Globan. compressa' or 'Prae. inconstans'.]
	b	65.25		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P1b' is the 'Subbotina triloculinoides -Globanomalina compressa/Praemurica inconstans Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995; emend. Berggren and Miller, 1988) from FAD of S. triloculinoides to FAD of G. compressa (formerly, before Wade et al'11, was "and/or P. inconstans").
	a	65.72		Paleocene Foram Zone P1 is the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina-Praemurica uncinata Interval Zone (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of Berggren and Miller, 1988) = gap from LAD of P. eugubina to FAD of P. uncinata.  Subzone 'P1a' is the 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina - Subbotina triloculinoides Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995), which is an emendation of the former P1a 'Parasubbotina pseudobulloides' subzone of Berggren & Miller (1988), but the range is essentially identical.  Note that both are a "gap" zone (LAD of eugubina to FAD of another marker).

	N18/N19	5.72		Pliocene Foram Zone PL1 (or N18-N19) Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent-range Zone was Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent Range Zone = FAD G. tumida to LAD G. nepenthes (Berggren et al., 1995)  Lourens et al (GTS2004) also place base of "M14" at this level, but Berggren used an earlier event.  There is no major Foram datum to mark the base of the Pliocene.History of zone and regional events are summarized in Berggren et al. (1995).   Miocene/Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl1a" WAS the 'Globorotalia tumida/Globorotalia cibaoensis Concurrent Range SubZone' (FAD of Globorotalia tumida to LAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and WAS equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N18' (or 'N19', which now begins BEFORE 'N18') of Blow (1979).  But, due to uncertainty in G. cibaoensis LAD, the subzones were removed in Wade et al'11.  [Miocene/Pliocene boundary interval Foram Zone "N18" is essentially non-existent in Berggren's table and GTS2004, because its base (FAD G. tumida) is now AFTER the base of N19 (FAD Sphaeroidinella dehiscens).]

The Atlantic event is no longer used by him as a zonal marker between M13b and M14 and the resulting zone in the Atlantic scheme is therefore a M14-M13b composite, pending further investigation.]]  The Globorotalia plesiotumida/Globorotalia lenguaensis Concurrent-range Subzone [fomerly)'Globigerinoides extremus/Globorotalia plesiotumida -Globorotalia lenguaensis Interval SubZone' (FAD of Globig. extremus/ Globorot.plesiotumida to LAD of Globorotalia lenguaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995)],  is equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N17' of Blow (1969).  M13b base defined either by:  Glob. plesiotumida or Neo. humerosa. The base of "N17" was defined as the initial evolutionary FAD of Gt.

Miocene Foram Zone "M13a" is the 'Neogloboquadrina acostaensis -Globigerinoides extremus/Globorotalia plesiotumida Interval SubZone' (FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis to FAD of Globig. extremus and/or Globorot.plesiotumida) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N16' of Blow (1979).

	N15	10.46	dashed	DASHED due to diachroneity of marker.  Miocene Foram Zone "M12" (or N15) is Globigerinoides trilobus Partial-range Zone (formerly the 'Neogloboquadrina mayeri -Neogloboquadrina acostaensis Interval Zone') = (LAD of Neogloboquadrina mayeri to FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N15' of Blow (1979).

Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone, which may explain its apparent brief extent (0.15 myr) in the global compilation.  However, in some regions, a further subdivision into 2 subzones can be made by Globigerinoides ruber.
	N12	13.41		Miocene Foram Zone "M9" (or N12) Fohsella fohsi Taxon-range Zone [was the Globorotalia fohsi lobata-globorotalia fohsi robusta Interval Zone] = FAD to LAD of F. fohsi (Berggren et al., 1995; redefined in Wade et al'11).  Base is same as base of N12 of Blow (1969, 1979), and top is probably near mid-N13.  Magnetochronologic calibration of boundaries is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy in DSDP Hole 563 by Wright and Miller (1992).  Two subzones -- Miocene Foram SubZone "M9a" Fohsella fohsi Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was the 'Globorotalia fohsi lobata Lineage SubZone'] is equivalent to "old" (initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata to evolutionary FAD of its descendent Globorotalia fohsi robusta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to lower portion of Zone 'N12' of Blow (1979).  Miocene Foram Zone "M8" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str. Lineage Zone' ( initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi s.str. to initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N11' of Blow (1979).  However, species "lobata" apparently combined with Fohsella "fohsi" in zonal scheme of Lourens et al. (in GTS2004).  This effectively removed the thin "M8" of Berggren et al., 1995.

This is a very brief interval the global compilation of datums.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; ref [b] which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6, but table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis". 
	N8	16.38		Miocene Foram Zone M5 (or N8) Praeorbulina sicana Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the Praeorbulina sicana-Orbulina suturalis Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995)] = FAD of P. sicana to FAD of O. suturalis; equivalent to Zone "N8" of Blow (1969, 1979.  Two subzones:  VERY SHORT Miocene Foram Zone "M5a" is Praeorbulina sicana Lowest-occurrence Subzone [was 'Praeorbulina sicana -Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. Interval Subzone'] = (FAD of Praeorbulina sicana to FAD of Pr. glomerosa sensu stricto) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This short subzone spans the lowermost part of the 'N8' zone.  The base of this zone is used to denote the base of the Langhian Substage (base of Middle Miocene), although this boundary may be more closely associated with the slightly younger FAD of Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. (base of Subzone 'M5b'), which would render this substage about 0.3 myr shorter in duration.
	N7	17.54		Miocene Foram Zone "M4" (or N7) Globigerinoides bisphericus Partial-range Zone [was Catapsydrax dissimilis-Praeorbulina sicana Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995)]; equivalent to N7 of Blow (1969, 1979), and defined as LAD of C. dissimilis and/or C. unicavus to FAD of P. sicana; with 2 subzones.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone of 1 myr.  Miocene Foram Zone "M4a" is 'Catapsydrax dissimilis -Globorotalia birnageae Interval SubZone" (LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus to FAD of Globorotalia birnageae) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This subzone spans the lower part of the 'N7' zone.  Subzone "M4b" Fohsella birnageae Lowest Occurrence Subzone [was 'Globigerinoides bisphericus Partial Range Zone' (FAD of Globorotalia birnageae to FAD of Praeorbulina sicana) (Berggren et al., 1995)].  This short subzone spans the upper part of the 'N7' zone; but now is within the "overlying" M5!
	N6	17.59		Brief "N6" is from FAD of Globigeriantella insueta s.str. to LAD of C. dissimilis.  Not used in later zonations by Berggren et al, etc.
	N5	21.12		Miocene Foram Zone "M2" (or N5) Globoquadrina binaiensis Partial-range Zone [was 'Catapsydrax dissimilis Partial Range Zone'] = (LAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globigerinatella sp. (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is equivalent to the 'N5' zone.  Note that this 3 m.y. zone is essentially a "gap" zone.
	N4	23.5		Wade (email Oct'11 to J.Ogg) "Base of N4 and M1 are not the same. Zone M1 defined by base Paragloborotalia kugleri.   Zone N4 (as per Kennett and Srinivasan, 1983) defined by base common occurrence of Globigerinoides primordius = 23.6 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004).
	P22	26.93		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P22' (and 'N3').  O6 zone Globigerina ciperoensis Partial-range Zone is the lower part of the former O6 [was 'Globigerina ciperoensis Partial Range Subzone'] = (LAD of Parabloborotalia opima opima to FAD of Globorotalia kugleri) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.
	P21	29.18		Oligocene Foram Zone P21 is the Globigerina angulisuturalis/Paragloborotalia opima opima Concurrent Range Zone (Blow, 1969; Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD to LAD, and is subdivided into 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P21a' (= Zone O4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is defined as the 'Globigerina angulisuturalis / Chiloguembelina cubensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of G. angul. to LAD of Chil. cubensis) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).
	P20	30.28		Oligocene Foram Zone "P20" (= Zone O3 of Berggren-Pearson '05) (and "N1") is defined as the 'Globigerina sellii Partial Range Zone' (LAD of '"T." ampliaperatura' to FAD of 'Globigerina angulisuturalis') by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.
	P19	32.1		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P19' (= Zone O2 of Berggren-Pearson '04) is defined as the "'Turborotalia' ampliapertura Interval Zone' (LAD of Pseudohastigerina spp. to LAD of 'T.' ampliapertura) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  "The historical vicissitudes associated with this zone" are discussed in Berggren & MIller (1988). 
	P18	34.03		Eocene Foram Zone P18 = Turborotalia cerroazulensis-Pseudohastigerina spp. Interval Zone (LAD to LAD) (Berggren et al., 1995). Berggren and Miller (1988) used the HO of 'T. ceroazulensis' (rather than that of 'Hantkenina') to denote the P17/18 boundary because of its greater potential for preservation.  The base is defined by Berggren & Miller (1988) as LAD Turbo. cerroazulensis; rather than LAD Hankenina -- but these are nearly synchronous events.  This zone has undergone numerous changes in definitions (briefly reviewed in Berggren et al., 1995).
	P16 / P17	35.71		Eocene Foram Zone P16 is the 'Turborotalia cunialensis/Cribrohantkenina inflata Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Turbo. cunialensis to LAD of Crib. inflata) (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995).  Previously, the base was FAD of Crib. inflata; but Berggren et al. changed to the more common and better calibrated Turbo. cunialensis.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) discontinued this P16 Zone and zonal marker due to high diachroneity.  Wade (email to J.Ogg; Oct'11) -- "Zone P17 continues to be problematic as the zonal marker has been synonymised. A solution is to call this P16/P17.
	P15	38.62		Eocene Foram Zone P15 is the 'Porticulasphaera semiinvoluta Interval Zone' (FAD of P. semiinvoluta to FAD of Turborotalia cunialensis) (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995).  Previously, the top of zone was FAD of Crib. inflata (e.g., Blow, 1979), which is less common and poorly calibrated.
	P14	40.03		Eocene Foram Zone E13 = Morozovelloides crassatus Highest-occurrence Zone = LAD of Orbulinoides beckmanni to LAD of Morozovella crassata.    Eocene Foram Zone P14 (nearly same as E13 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Truncorotaloides rohri -Morozovella spinulosa Partial Range Zone') = LAD of G. beckmanni to FAD of P. semiinvoluta (Berggren and Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.
	P13	40.49		Eocene Foram Zone P13 (= Zone E12) of Berggren-Pearson '05) Orbulinoides beckmanni Taxon-range Zone [was called the 'Globigerapsis (now Orbulinoides) beckmanni Total Range Zone'] = FAD to LAD of name species (Bolli, 1957; Berggren et al., 1995).
	P12	43.26		Eocene Foram Zone P12 is the 'Morozovella lehneri Partial Range Zone' (LAD of M. aragonensis to FAD of G. beckmanni) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.
	P11	43.88	dotted	DASHED (poor magstrat control).  Eocene Foram Zone P11 (= Zone E9 of Berggren-Pearson '05 = ) is the Globigerinatheka kugleri / Morozovella aragonensis Concurrent-range Zone (FAD to LAD) (Berggren, 1969, but with complicated history; see redefinition in Berggren et al., 1995).
	P10	44.49	dotted	DASHED -- Wade (email of Oct'11 to J.Ogg) -- Base Zone E8 and P10 are not the same. Base Zone E8 = base G. nuttalli = 45.5 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004), this is calibrated in Payros et al. (2007) and therefore should be a solid line. Base P10 = base Hantkenina = 43.5 Ma as per Gradstein et al.,  2004, reference is Payros et al. (2007). P10 is thus now a very short zone."    The previous Eocene Foram Zone P10 (= essentially E8 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is EITHER the 'G. nuttalli zone (beginning at FAD) or the 'Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to the FAD of 'Globigerapsis kugleri') (Berggren & Miller, 1988; = Hankenina aragonensis Zone of Bolli, 1957).  Rather confusing!  FAD of G. nuttalli (which is NOT the same as Hantkenina nuttalli) is NOW dashed at approximately C21n.8  (Lutetian GSSP publication, Episodes 2011) and is suggested as alternate (base of E8) zonal datum by Berggren and Pearson (2005).   This is nearly 3 million years higher than in Berggren-Pearson!  Wade et al'11 summarize: "In a detailed magnetobiostratigraphic study of an expanded lower-middle Eocene succession from the western Pyrenees, Payros et al. (2007) examined the divergence of planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 and the standard zonation (BKSA95). Unlike BKSA95 which places the boundary between planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 within calcareous nannofossil Zone NP14 (Subzone CP12a) and magnetic polarity Chron C22n/C21r boundary, they found the boundary to occur within Zone NP15 (=Zone CP13) and Chron C20r.  ... The P9/P10 zonal boundary is therefore a surprising 3.1 myr younger than in BKSA95."  AND, the First occurrence of Hantkenina (other base of P10) which was a working definition of base of Lutetian Stage but later found to be significantly higher (may be nearly top of C20r -- maybe 2 myr higher still!).  Calibration of these events needs further careful study.  
	P9	50.2		Eocene Foram Zone E7 = Acarinina cuneicamerata Lowest-occurrence Zone of Wade et al'11 = now defined as FAD of Acarinina cuneicamerata to the FAD of Guembelitrioides nuttalli.  This follows an "alternative" of Berggren-Pearson '05, who  had also used a top of FAD of Hantkenina nuttalii  Eocene Foram Zone P9 is the 'Planorotalites palmerae -Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to FAD) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Lower Subzone E7a is to the FAD of Turborotalia frontosa.
	P8	50.67		Eocene Foram Zone E6 = Acarinina pentacamerata Partial-range Zone = gap between LAD of M. subbotinae to FAD of A.  pentacamerata.  Eocene Foram Zone P8 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05).  Eocene Foram Zone P8 is the Morozovella aragonensis Partial Range Zone = 'gap' between LAD of Moro. subbotinae (was M. formosa) to FAD of Planorotalites palmerae (Berggren & Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  However, Aubrey et al. (1988, with Berggren as a co-author), places base of P8 at "FAD of Acarinina pentacamerata", and draws this boundary "approximately midway between the boundaries of Zones P6/P7 and P8/P9" (p. 735).  The simultaneous publication of conflicting definitions for base of Zone P8 (both with Berggren as an author, and neither discussing the change) was confusing until Wade et al'11 clarified.
	P7	52.54		Eocene Foram Zone E5 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella aragonensis / Morozovella subbotinae Concurrent-range Zone (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. subbotinae.  Eocene Foram Zone P7 is the 'Morozovella aragonensis/Morozovella formosa formosa Concurrent Range Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. formosa
	P6b	54.61		Eocene Foram Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella formosa Lowest-occurrence Zone = FAD of Moro. formosa to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.   Subzone "P6b" of Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6c" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella formosa formosa/Morozovella lensiformis -Morozovella aragonensis Interval SubZone"; and from simultaneous FAD of Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Moro. lensiformis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.
	P6a	55.2		DASH (uncertain placement within chron) (but Wade requested J.Ogg to remove "dash" via e-mail 18July2011) -- .  Eocene Foram Zone E3 Morozovella marginodentata Partial-range Zone = gap between LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. formosa.   Eocene Foram Zone P6 is the Morozovella subbotinae Partial Range Zone (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995) = "gap" from LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.  The P5/6a boundary was used in some publications to approx. Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  Near-basal Eocene Foram SubZone "P6a" of new Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6b" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name was "Morozovella velascoensis -Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Morozovella lensiformis Interval SubZone".  Note that this is a "gap" zone between LAD of 'M. velasoensis' and FAD of 'M. formosa formosa/lensiformis'.
	P5	57.1		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P5', as defined by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM) is the 'Morozovella velascoensis Interval Zone' = LAD of Glob. pseudomenardii to LAD of Moro. velascoensis.  This definition of P5 encompasses the former P5 and P6a zones of Berggren and Miller (1988).
	P4	60.52		Acarinina subsphaerica Partial-range Subzone = gap between LAD of P. variospira to FAD of A. coldadoensis.  This is NEW version of SubZone P4b (Berggren et al, 2000).  Previously, Berggren et al. (1995) version of Paleocene Foram Subzone 'P4b' had been defined as the 'Acarinina subsphaerica -Acarinina soldadoensis Interval Zone' -- 'gap' between LAD of 'Acar. subsphaerica' and FAD of 'Acar. soldadoensis'.
	P3	62.29		Paleocene Foram Zone P3 Morozovella angulata Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the Morozovella angulata-Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone] = FAD of P. angulata to FAD of G. pseudomenardii (defined in Berggren et al., 1995, revised in Wade et al'11; emend. of P3 of Berggren and Miller, 1988) with 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P3a' is the 'Morozovella angulata -Muricella albeari Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995).  An earlier version of subzone P3a used the FAD of Igorina pusilla top define the top of subzone, but this FAD is rare and reported to occur at the base of P3 (Berggren et al., 1995).  A working base of the Selandian substage (top of Danian) is the P2/P3 boundary (Berggren et al., 1995).
	P2	62.6		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P2' Praemurica uncinata Lowest-occurrence Zone [was the 'Praemurica uncinata -Morozovella angulata Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995)] = FAD of P. uncinata to FAD of M. angulata;  equivalent to the same zone of Berggren and Miller (1988).  In general, this brief zone only encompasses 2-3 m in deep sea sites.
	P1	65.72		Paleocene Foram Zone P1 is the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina-Praemurica uncinata Interval Zone (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of Berggren and Miller, 1988) = gap from LAD of P. eugubina to FAD of P. uncinata.  Subzone 'P1a' is the 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina - Subbotina triloculinoides Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995), which is an emendation of the former P1a 'Parasubbotina pseudobulloides' subzone of Berggren & Miller (1988), but the range is essentially identical.  Note that both are a "gap" zone (LAD of eugubina to FAD of another marker).
	Pa	66		Paleocene Foraminifer Zone P-alpha is the Total Range Zone of "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina"   [Liu, (1993) emendation of Blow's (1979) "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Partial-range Zone"; in turn from Luterbacher & Premoli Silva's (1964) "Globigerina eugubina Zone"; however, Smit (1982) uses "G. eugubina Zone" as "P1a"].  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).
	P0	66.04		Basal Paleocene Planktonic Foraminifer Zone P0 (= Guembelitria cretacea, Partial range zone) is from Keller (1988; emendation of Smit, 1982).  Gap between Base = extinction of Rugoglobigerina, Globotruncana, Globotruncanella and associated taxa.  Top = FAD of P. eugubina.  See Berggren et al. (SEPM, 1995) for a page discussing the P0, P-alpha, P1 definition history and problems.  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).

LAD
	Globorotalia tosaensis	0.61		Base Pt1b (Top Pt1a).  Astronomically tuned from Equatorial Pacific ODP Legs 111 & 138. Berggren et al. (1995) had assigned as early Brunhes; 0.65 Ma (= C1n.165); and noted that Globorotalia tosaensis LAD is placed earlier, at latest Matuyama (0.9 Ma) by Caproniere et al. (1994). [EP: Mix et al. (1995), Shipboard Scientific Party (1990); SP: Chaproniere et al. (1994)]
	Globigerinoides fistulosus	1.88		Used Wade et al'11 value from table "The calibration from Site 677 is poorly constrained between relatively widely spaced core catcher samples and requires further investigation, thus we use the LAD of Globigerinoides fistulosus from Ceara Rise of 1.88 Ma."  -- Base Pt1a (Top PL6).  SA: Astronomically tuned from Leg 154 (925, 926). EP: Astronomically tuned as 1.77 Ma from Leg 111 (677) in Jenkins & Houghton (1989) but  this was based on widely spaced core catcher samples according to Wade et al. (2011). These authors also note the mistake in Berggren et al. (1995b, table 6) where 1.6 Ma should read 1.77 Ma.
	Globorotalia miocenica [Atl.], Globorotalia pseudomiocenica [Indo-Pac.]	2.39		Dual markers for Base of PL6 [or, due to LADs, the top of PL5.  G. miocenica (was Menardella (Globorotalia) miocenica) -- Astronomically tuned from ODP Sites 925 & 926. Essentially same as Berggren et al (1995b), who assigned to early Matuyama (below Reunion Subchron); 2.30 Ma [a] =C2r.3r.8.  (Atlantic reappearance of Pulleniatina near this level).
	Dentoglobigerina altispira [Atl.]	3.13	dashed	Base PL5 (or, due to LAD, top of PL4; and alternate for top of N20 -- see comments on PL5 Zone).  Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. This LAD is reported as slightly earlier (3.19 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean and much earlier (3.47 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Berggren et al. (1995) had similar assignment in the South Atlantic -- C2An.1r (Kaena); 3.09 Ma. However, 0.08 myr earlier in Mediterranean in late Mammoth to early Kaena C2An.2n; or about 3.17 Ma, equivalent to a calibration of about C2Ar.1r.3. [M: Lourens et al. (1996a), Zachariasse et al. (1989), Hilgen (1991b); SA: Chaisson & Pearson (1997), Shipboard Scientific Party (1995), Tiedemann & Franz (1997), Berggren et al. (1995b); EP: Mix et al.

	Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina [Atl.]	3.16	dashed	Base PL4 (or, due to LAD, then top of PL3, and alternate for top of Zone N20).     NOTE that calibrations imply NO DURATION of Zone PL4 in Atlantic; and extremely brief (but earlier) elsewhere.  To avoid confusion on graphics, the base of PL4 has been lowered by 0.01 myr (3.14 Ma, instead of 3.13 Ma in Lourens et al., 2004 compilation).  Astronomically tuned as 3.14 Ma from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. Wade et al. (2011) used this 3.16 Ma age. This LAD is reported as slightly earlier (3.17 Ma) in astronomically tuned eastern Mediterranean and much earlier (3.59 Ma) at astronomically tuned Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138. Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as base Kaena (3.12 Ma = C2An.1r.0) and noted that Pliocene foram 'Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina' LAD occurs about 0.1 m.y. earlier (top of Mammoth, or 3.21 Ma) in the Mediterranean. [M: Lourens et al. (1996a), Zachariasse et al. (1989), Hilgen (1991b); SA: Chaisson & Pearson (1997), Shipboard Scientific Party (1995), Tiedemann & Franz (1997), Berggren et al. (1995b); EP: Mix et al. (1995), Shipboard Scientific Party (1990), Shackleton et al. (1995a)]
	Dentoglobigerina altispira [Pac.]	3.47	dashed	Base of Pacific PL5 -- This LAD is reported as much earlier (3.47 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 (Refs 1, 2, 5, 6) -- GTS2004 Neogene foram table. 
	Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina [Pac.]	3.59	dashed	Base of Pacific PL4 -- This LAD is reported as much earlier (3.59 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Wade et al. (2011) "The duration of Biochron PL4 is estimated to be 30 kyr in the Atlantic Ocean and 110 kyr in the Pacific Ocean."  REFS: Wade et al. (2011); Shackleton et al. (1995)
	Globorotalia margaritae	3.85		Was "Hirsutella (Globorotalia) margaritae".  Defines top of PL2; (was approx. base of Piacenzian stage in Berggren et al., 1995).  Cycle-calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean as 3.81 Ma. This LAD is reported slightly earlier (3.85 Ma) at astronomically tuned South Atlantic Sites 925 & 926. This calibration was used by Wade et al. (2011) and is retained here. Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as Gauss/Gilbert boundary in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific (3.58 Ma = Base C2An.3n) based on Saito et al. (1975). They reported this event to have occurred 0.2 m.y. earlier in Mediterranean (late Gilbert, or 3.79 Ma). The LCO occurs in the Mediterranean just above Cochiti Subchron (3.96 Ma). 
	Globoturborotalita nepenthes	4.37		Base PL2 (or, due to LAD, Defines top of PL1; & N19/N20 boundary.).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. Berggren et al. (1995b) assign as top Cochiti Subchron; 4.20 Ma = C3n.1n.8 based on sites in the Equatorial Pacific. [Lourens et al., GTS2004 appendix; SA: Chaisson & Pearson (1997), Shipboard Scientific Party (1995), Tiedemann & Franz (1997); EP: Hays et al. (1969), Saito et al. (1975), Berggren et al. (1983), Pujol (1983)]
	Globoquadrina dehiscens	5.92		Astrochronology age by Wade et al. (2011) is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C3r (early Gilbert), 5.8 Ma = C3r.15 [Datum levels in C3r scaled proportionally to match Berggren's relative spacing.]. 'Globoquadrina dehiscens' LAD is calibrated in ODP Hole 588 in SW Pacific, and is synchronous in nearby Holes 586B,587,590 and in Indian Ocean. However, Berggren (1994 version of SEPM compilation) indicated that this LAD is apparently diachronous by about 1 myr from C3Bn (6.8 Ma) in subtropics to C3r.7 (5.5 Ma) in tropics. Wade et al. (2011) clarify: "However, Hodell and Kennett (1986) have shown the LAD of G. dehiscens to be diachronous, and the extinction appears to occur earlier in higher latitudes in comparison to tropical sites."   Miocene/Pliocene boundary interval Foram Zone "N18" is essentially non-existent in Berggren's table and GTS2004, because its base (FAD G. tumida) is now AFTER the base of N19 (FAD Sphaeroidinella dehiscens).
	Globorotalia lenguaensis [Pac.]	6.14		Miocene foram 'Globorotalia lenguaensis' LAD defines top of M13 [but see NOTE for Zone M14 and Subzone M13b].  Pacific calibration: Same scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a) - LAD is directly calibrated to C3An.1n in ODP Hole 840 (Tonga Platform, SW Pacific) and Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau, equatorial West Pacific).  This LAD occurs just below FAD of P. primalis at ODP 840 and just above it at ODP 806B.  The corresponding age is about 6.0 Ma (Cande & Kent, 1995). Chron-age assignment = C3An.1n at 6.0 Ma = C3An.1n.5. Atlantic calibration: Astronomically tuned in South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 (8.97 Ma in Lourens et al. 2004). In Hole 519 (S. Atl.), calibrated to upper C4An (about 8.7 Ma) in Poore et al. (1983).  In E68-136 (Gulf of Mexico), the LAD occurs about 10m above the FAD of Globorotalia plesiotumida (=base of N17) and within range of Minylitha convallis and above the LAD of Discoaster bollii.  In contrast, in E66-73, the LAD is at the same level as FAD of G. plesiotumida (8.58 Ma), and below the FAD of M. convallis and LAD of D. bollii (Zhang et al., 1993; Aubry, 1993). Following Turco et al. (2002), Lourens et al. (2004) significantly revised the LAD of G. lenguaensis to 8.97 Ma. This revised age is significantly older than reported in Berggren et al. (1995a) (derived from the Tonga Plateau, SW Pacific). This revision, Wade et al. (2011) argued would place this event within the M13a Subzone, "inconsistent with the established order of bioevents". In the Gulf of Mexico, however, Zhang et al. (1993) found the Top of G. lenguaensis near the same horizon as the Top G. plesiotumida (8.52 Ma; Table 1), more consistent with the older age suggested by Turco et al. (2002). Wade et al. (2011) argued that they retained the Berggren et al. (1995) age for stability, pending further investigation. In contrast to Wade et al. (2011), this study chooses to honor both calibrations and recognizes significant diachrony between the Atlantic and Pacific ages of LAD of G. lenguaensis. The Atlantic event is herein no longer used as a zonal marker between M13b and M14 and the resulting zone in the Atlantic scheme is therefore a M14-M13b composite, pending further investigation.
	Globorotalia lenguaensis (Atl. only)	8.97		See NOTE above for Pacific LAD of ~6.14 Ma.  Atlantic calibration: Astronomically tuned in South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 (8.97 Ma in Lourens et al. 2004). In Hole 519 (S. Atl.), calibrated to upper C4An (about 8.7 Ma) in Poore et al. (1983).  In E68-136 (Gulf of Mexico), the LAD occurs about 10m above the FAD of Globorotalia plesiotumida (=base of N17) and within range of Minylitha convallis and above the LAD of Discoaster bollii.

	Paragloborotalia mayeri [subtropical]	10.46	dashed	DASHED -- [Called "Paragloborotalia siakensis" or "Neogloboquadrina mayeri" in some tables. -- Turco et al. (2002) explains: "The taxonomic concept of this species is rather controversial. According to Bolli and Saunders (1982, 1985), P. siakensis represents a junior synonym of P. mayeri. Other authors (e.g. Kennett and Srinivasan, 1983; Iaccarino, 1985; Foresi et al., 1998) following the species concept of Blow (1969) regarded P. siakensis and P. mayeri as distinct species, but have different opinion about the distribution range and the phylogeny of P.mayeri."]  Astronomical age from Wade et al'11, who cited Lourens et al (GTS2004), in turn Chaisson and Pearson, 1997.  This is about 1 myr "above" the projected chron-age of Berggren et al. (1995) -- In North Atlantic Sites 558, 563 and 608 LAD of 'N. mayeri' was observed in close juxtaposition with FAD of 'N. acostaensis', essentially eliminating Foraminifer Zone N15 (=M12).  This has been varyingly interpreted as due to a hiatus in the North Atlantic (Aubry, 1993) or diachrony (ref. l,m).  Therefore, Berggren et al's assignment was C5r.2r; 11.4 Ma = C5r.2r.2.  This LAD also defined their Base of Medit. zone Mt9.  Wade et al'11 further clarify: "The extinction of Paragloborotalia mayeri has been recalibrated to 10.53 Ma as per Chaisson and Pearson (1997) (given as siakensis in Turco et al., 2002). This is significantly younger (870 kyr) than the previous reported age of 11.40 Ma in BKSA95. The interpolated age would place this event mid-C5n.2n rather than C5r.2r. The age used in BKSA95 is calibrated to the magnetostratigraphy at Site 563 (Miller et al., 1985) and this discrepancy may be due to diachrony between the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean.  Hilgen et al. (2000) noted the diachrony in the extinction of P. mayeri between the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and diachrony with higher latitudes was suggested by Miller et al. (1991).
	Paragloborotalia mayeri [temperate]	11.4	dashed	DASHED [SEE NOTE FOR P. mayeri (subtropical) at 10.46 Ma].   Hilgen et al. (2000) noted the diachrony in the extinction of P. mayeri between the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean and diachrony with higher latitudes was suggested by Miller et al. (1991).
	Fohsella fohsi	11.79		Formerly called 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta'.  [Wade et al'11 on Fohsella lineage:  "Taxonomic subdivision of this gradual chronocline into species and subspecies is inevitably subjective".]  Astronomically tuned "F. fohsi s.l." from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized by Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globorotalia fohsi robusta' LAD is calibrated in Hole 563 = C5An.1n; 11.9 Ma = top C5An.1n.
	Praeorbulina  sicana	14.53		Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Also in the South Atlantic (DSDP Leg 72), Berggren et al. (1995a) had assigned as Chron C5B.1n.
	Catapsydrax dissimilis	17.54		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix).  Berggren et al. (1995a) calibrate 'Catapsydrax dissimilis' LAD as recorded in Holes 558, 563, North Atlantic; and observed at top of polarity zone C5Dr in Hole 608 in interval of strong dissolution = Chron C5Dn (upper) = placed at C5Dn.9.
	Paragloborotalia" kugleri	21.12		Paragloborotalia is the temporary genus assignment by Wade et al'11 -- is Globorotalia in some publications.  Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix).  Berggren et al. (1995a) use this level as base of Medit. Zone Mt2, and note that Miocene foram 'Paragloborotalia kugleri' LAD is recorded in Hole 516F, South Atlantic, and at base of polarity zone C6An in Contessa Highway section = placed at Chron C6Ar.6.
	Paragloborotalia opima	26.93		Oligocene foram 'Paragloborotalia opima opima' (Berggren & Miller, 1988) defines top of P21.  This was called "G. opima opima" by Blow (1969), and is listed as only "P. opima" in Berggren 1995, SEPM).  Wade et al. (2011) diagram projects LAD as middle of Chron C9n (used here), but unfortunately, do not specify the reference sites for this chron calibration.  GTS04 had slightly younger as C9n.9 = 26.83 Ma [=P315-0.9*Q315] =  same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- The LAD is recorded between polarity zones C9n and C8n in Hole 516F; individuals become significantly smaller above C9n and are not typical of 'P. opima s.s.' in Hole 558 (see also discussion in Berggren and Miller, 1988) = C9n (upper); 27.1 Ma => C9n.9.
	Chiloguembelina cubensis (LCO)	28.09		Base of Chattian (working version) is base of Chron C10n.1n.  Last common occurrence of C. cubensis has also been used to place base-Chattian (Coccioni et al., 2008, GSA Bull.; and in GTS2004).  Coccioni et al. (2008; Italian sections) have this LCO at about 2/3rds up in Chron C10n (subchrons C10n.1n and .2n were not resolved).  Berggren and Pearson (2005) indicate that the "LAD is recorded in mid-part of polarity zone C10n in Holes 747A (Berggren et al., 1985, Li et al., 1992), 749 (Berggren, 1992), in the mid-part of concatenated C9n and C10n in Hole 748B (Berggren, 1992), and associated approximately with C10n in Holes 689B and 690B (Stott & Kennett, 1990).  "Whether this datum refers to extinction or strong reduction in numbers remains a moot point; records of discontinuouss presence in reduced numbers of this taxon into basal Miocene levels continue (Leckie et al., 1993)". Wade et al. (2011) conclude with assigning this LCO a numerical value within 0.05 myr of the base of Chron C10n.1n on their time scale; therefore, base of Chron C10n.1n is retained here. 
	Turborotalia ampliapertura	30.28		Oligocene foram 'Turborotalia ampliapertura' defines top of P19, and was formerly 'Globigerina ampliapertura' (e.g., Blow, 1969).  Age-calibration from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- LAD is recorded in polarity zone C11r in Holes 516F (South Atlantic) and 558 (North Atlantic) and St. Stephen's Quarry, Alabama borehole (North Atlantic).  Their 30.3 Ma age is Chron C11r.5 on their polarity scale.
	Pseudohastigerina naguewichiensis	32.1		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar to chron-age by Berggren et al. (1995a) -- Oligocene foram 'Pseudohastigerina spp.' LAD defines top of P18, and is recorded in South Atlantic Hole 516F, North Atlantic Holes 558, 563 and St. Stephen's Quarry, Alabama borehole.   Earliest Oligocene foraminifer LAD of Psudohastigerina datum was noted as "C11r" in Berggren tables, but it seems to be a typographic error, because his age placement and chronologic order of this datum was at "32.0 Ma", hence in at Chron C12r..5 on their polarity scale (used here).
	Hantkenina alabamensis; Hantkenina spp.	33.89		Basal LAD = Marker for Eocene/Olig boundary = Chron C13.86.  Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- the youngest of 3 normal "events" in polarity chron C13r in Contessa Highway section (Nocci et al., 1986) and above the normal "event" C13n.2n at Massignano (Coccione et al., 1988), where this LAD defines the Eocene/Oligocene boundary.
	Globigerinatheka index	34.61		One of the few taxa which has an LAD that is isochronous between low and high latitudes and provinces.  One of the few taxa which has an LAD that is isochronous between low and high latitudes and provinces.  Age calibration from Berggren and Pearson (2005, which as extended discussion) is similar to Berggren et al. (1995a) -- 'Globigerapsis index' LAD is essentially coincident with the LAD of 'Discoaster saipanensis' and 'Discoaster barbadoensis' and with lower of 3 normal "events" in polarity chron C13r in Contessa Highway section (Nocci et al., 1986, Premoli-Silva et al., 1988a).   This LAD occurs in younger part of polarity chron C13r on Kerguelen Plateau (Site 748) (ref. e) and appears to be globally reliable datum.  Recorded at a level in  Hole 689B (Weddell Sea) identified as C16n, but an alternative interpretation of the paleomagnetic stratigraphy suggests this may be C15n, in which case the (apparent) latitudinal diachrony of the HO of Gl. index would be significantly reduced, if not eliminated, inasmuch as dissolution is strong across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary interval at high latitudes. Their concluding 34.3 Ma age is Chron C13r.3 on their polarity scale.
	Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta	36.18		Genus was formerly Porticulasphaera.  Located in Italian Massignano section within C15r; but Berggren & Pearson (2005) estimate as 35.8 Ma or at Chron C16n.2n.8 on their polarity scale (used here).
	Morozovelloides crassatus	38.25		Formerly "Morozovella crassata", now Morozovelloides crassatus.  M. crassata is the senior synonym of Morozovella spinulosa.  Wade et al. (2011) assign as Chron C17n.3n.5; which is similar to chron-age by Berggren and Pearson (2005) and Berggren et al. (1995).
	Orbulinoides beckmanni	40.03		Defines base of P14 (or E13).  Wade et al. (2011) have same age calibration as Berggren and Pearson (2005) following Wade (2004) using Site 1052, which is at Chron C18n.2n.25 on their polarity scale.
	Guembelitrioides nuttalli	42.07	dashed	DASHED:  Wade et al. (2011): "The age of the HO of Guembelitrioides nuttalli in not well constrained and requires further study."  Age assignment by Berggren and Pearson (2005) of 42.3 Ma is at Chron C19r.25 on their polarity scale.
	Morozovella aragonensis	43.26		Defines top of P11 or E9.  Assignment by Berggren and Pearson (2005) is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a).  Their 43.6 Ma is Chron C20n.15 on their polarity scale.
	Morozovella subbotinae	50.67		LAD of M. subbotinae defines top of E5 (base of E6), which is coeval with LAD of M. formosa (top of P7 = base of P8).  Chron-age from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- Eocene Foram Zone P8 base (LAD of 'Morozovella formosa') is drawn as uppermost C23n in chart in Aubry et al. (1988); and is shown with an age of 50.8 Ma in Berggren (1995, SEPM); but the source of these calibrations are not cited.  Assignment = uppermost C23n = placed here as Chron C23n.1n.8
	Morozovella velascoensis	55.2		DASH (but Wade requested J.Ogg to remove "dash" via e-mail 18July2011) -- Wade et al. (2011) projects as 54.9 Ma relative to GTS04 polarity chrons, therefore at Chron C24r.61 (used here).  Berggren and Pearson (2005), puts this LAD 0.2 myr higher than Berggren et al. (1995a) -- This LAD is recorded in younger part of Chron C24r in Hole 577 and in mid-C24r in Hole 577 (at 81.98 m).  However, paleomagnetic data (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86: 449, Fig. 7b) suggests a hiatus occurs between ~82m & 83 m in Hole 577, which would have the effect of depressing (rendering older) the HO of 'M. velascoensis'.  The HO of 'M. velascoensis' in Hole 577 is in Nannofossil zone CP8 (=NP9) (Monechi, 1985: 310, Table 5) which supports interpretation of hiatus in Hole 577, because the LO of 'M. valascoensis' is in Nannofossil Zone NP10.  Furthermore, Monechi (1985: p.307) indicates absence of extremely condensed sedimentation across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary interval.  Essentially, it is not yet possible to position this LAD proportionally within the long Chron C24r.
	Globanomalina pseudomenardii	57.1		LAD defines top of Zone P4.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) have similar chron-age calibration (base of Chron C24r) as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii' was called "Planorotallites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).  The LAD (= base Zone P5) is recorded in North Pacific Shatsky Rise Hole 577 at either base of polarity chron C24r (Corfield, 1987) and or top C25n (Liu & Olsson pers comm., 1993) and in Indian Ocean Hole 752 at top C25n (Pospichal et al., 1991).  Juxtaposition/overlap of Gl. pseudomenardii LAD and Gt. subbotinae FAD is observed in Holes 465 and 758 (Nederbragt & van Hinte, 1987).  [Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii' was called "Planorotallites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).]
	Parasubbotina variospira	60.52		LAD defines top of revised zone P4a (e.g., Berggren and Pearson, 2005).  Berggren and Pearson (2005) assignment follows Berggren et al. (1995a) [as "P. variolaria" LAD and "P. varianta" LAD] who calibrated this event in North Atlantic Hole 384 and at comparable levels but without paleomagnetic control in Holes 465 (Eq. Pacific). Berggren et al. (1995a) project as 59.2 Ma or Chron C26r.57 on their polarity scale.
	Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina	65.72		Defines base of zone P1a.  [called 'Globigerina eugubina' in some older publications]  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a): The LAD, defining the top of Zone P-alpha, is near the FAD of P. pseudobulloides; and Berggren et al. (1995a) "admittedly somewhat arbitrarily" placed both events just below the polarity chron C29n/r boundary (p.146) = Chron C29r.95.
	Racemiguembelina fructicosa; LADs of other Cret. Forams	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	Abathomphalus mayaroensis	66.39		Brian Huber (written comm., Sept 2011): "Add Plummerita hantkeninoides zone with dashed base at top Maastrichtian using Li and Keller, 1998 age (about 350 kyr below K/Pg)".  Assumed that this is marked by LAD of A. mayaroensis, which SEPM'98 had assigned as ~0.3 m.y. before K/T
	Radotruncana calcarata	75.71		Calcarata was previously assigned to genus Globotruncanita.  DASH -- SEPM'98 places at Chron C33n.85 (74.47 Ma on GTS04 magnetics); but Huber et al'08 assign as 75.57 Ma relative to those magnetics (which would be C33n.75; although their text says C32n.92).
	Dicarinella asymetrica	83.64		Coeval with base of C33r.  Top of Santonian in SEPM'98; but this is circular if the debate is whether to use this LAD as a major marker for defining base-Cenomanian.
	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	92.99		For now, LAD of H. helvetica assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone to put coeval with FAD of nanno E. eximius.  But that nanno FAD might be diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (it is above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.).  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.  Base of  P. percarinatus ammonite zone on SEPM'98 chart; which is about 0.6 myr younger.
	Rotalipora cushmani	94.3	dashed	DASH -- Not well calibrated, because top at Gubbio is preservation and Morocco suggests diachronous (Petrizzo; at UCL nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  SEPM'98 places arbitrary (?) at 0.4 myr before top of Cenomanian (= top of Rotalipora genus?) -- used here.  Caron (1985) indicates base of this zone as FAD of W. archaeocretacea, rather than LAD of R. cushmani; and  this FAD is ~0.6 myr below.
	Paraticinella eubejaouaensis	113.26		Base of former H. planispira foraminifer zone (assumed "LAD" of T. bejaouaensis" definition is used by them?) is 31.5 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (Huang et al, 2010) at Piobbico.  Brian Huber (to J.Ogg; 15Aug11 "Note that there is no longer a planispira zone because true planispira did not evolve until the late Albian!")  Calibrations of other authors are inconsistent -- the base of the H. planispira Zone is placed ABOVE base of P. columnata in Leckie et al. (2002), middle of H.jacobi ammonite zone of Late Aptian (Herle et al., 2004) and much higher as the middle of Lower Albian by Bellier et al. (2000) -- and other assignments are briefly reviewed in Petrizzo et al. (Newsletters of Stratigraphy; in press 2011).  However, Hardenbol et al. (1998) place the FAD of H. planispira below the FAD of P. columnata, as is indicated at Piobbico and at the reference sections in SE France; thereforehad assigned as 50% up in H. jacobi Zone. 
	Globigerinelloides algeriana	118.93		GAP ZONE -- Top G. algerianus (= base of Hedbergella trocoidea, H. gorbachikae, or Planomalina cheniourensis Zone, depending on author; which is essentially a "gap" zone) = 45.5 cycles of 405kyr below base-Cenomanian at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2011).  Brian Huber (to J.Ogg; 15Aug11 - "I now prefer using the Hedbergella infracretacea Zone since that species is so widespread and present within that stratigraphic interval."   GTS04 = 116.0 Ma  (was 115.2 in Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 m.y. before top of nufieldiensis Zone.   "gap zone" (LAD at base; FAD at top).  Not included in all foraminifer zonations.
	Leupoldina cabri	122.98		Top L. cabri (= base of G. ferreolensis zone) = 55.5 cycles of 405 kyr below base-Cenomanian in Piobbico core (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 120.7 Ma (was 118.2 in Leckie's table).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 1/5 from base of martinoides Zone. 
FAD
	Globorotalia truncatulinoides	1.93	dashed	DASH -- Highly diachronous marker for the base of N22 (Dowsett, 1988).  Formerly Truncorotalia (Globorotalia) truncatulinoides.  The astronomically calibrated subtropical South Atlantic age of 1.93 is from Wade et al'11 astrochronology.  As summarized in Lourens et al (GTS2004 appendix):  Age of 2.00 Ma calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean.  FAD occurs slightly later (1.93 Ma) in Atlantic Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren et al. (1995) assign as mid-Olduvai Subchron; ~1.90 Ma = C2n.4; but note that Pliocene Foram "Globorotalia truncatulinoides" FAD is 2.0 Ma (just below Olduvai) in Atl-Medit; but is much earlier at 2.58 Ma (base of Matuyama) in SW Pacfiic.

	Globorotalila miocenica [Atl.]	3.77		Also "Menardella (Globorotalila) miocenica" and an alternate definition for base of Zone N20-N21.   Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as C2An.3n (3.55 Ma = C2An.3n.1). Magnetochron assignment according to Berggren et al. (1983) and Pujol (1983).
	Globorotalia tumida (Pac.)	5.57		Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926, but Globorotalia tumida FAD is reported as later (5.57 Ma) at astronomically tuned Pacific ODP Legs 111 & 138. Berggren et al. (1995) dated this event in Hole 588 and found it to be synchronous in other SW Pacific sites (586B,587,590) and in Indian Ocean (Holes 114,219,237,238). This FAD is at a comparable position, but without paleomagnetic control, at Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau). They assign as C3r (early Gilbert); 5.6 Ma = C3r.45. [Srinivasan & Sinha (1992), Hodell & Kennett (1986)]
	Globorotalia tumida (Atl.)	5.72		Base PL1; N18 (but see Note on Glob. dehiscens).  Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. Globorotalia tumida FAD is reported as later (5.57 Ma) at astronomically tuned Pacific ODP Legs 111 & 138. Berggren et al. (1995) dated this event in Hole 588 and found it to be synchronous in other SW Pacific sites (586B,587,590) and in Indian Ocean (Holes 114,219,237,238). This FAD is at a comparable position, but without paleomagnetic control, at Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau). They assign as C3r (early Gilbert); 5.6 Ma = C3r.45.

	Globorotalia plesiotumida 	8.58		M13b base defined by:  Glob. plesiotumida (formerly also coeval FAD of Neo. humerosa). Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that 'Globorotalia plesiotumida' FAD is recorded in Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau, Equatorial Pacific), but its FAD was difficult to define owing to questionable lower occurrences.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned the FAD based on its lowest questionable occurrence, but its effective FCO may be about 0.5 m.y. higher (coeval with FAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis).  In the Gulf of Mexico, the FAD is recorded in upper part of Nannofossil Zone NN10, similar to the lower Pacific occurrences, and overlaps the upper part of Discoaster bollii range with the FAD slightly below FAD of nannofossil Minylitha convallis FAD (Zhang et al., 1993; Aubry, 1993).  A similar FAD level is in Buff Bay, Jamaica (Berggren, 1993; Aubry, 1993).  Berggren et al. (1995) assign the age as (C4r.2r); (8.3) = C4.2r.9 based on the Equatorial Pacific. [NA: Zhang et al.

	Neogloboquadrina acostaensis [subtropical]	9.83	dashed	DASHED -- Astronomically tuned in the South Atlantic and Eastern Mediterranean. This FAD is younger (9.8 Ma) in Atlantic Sites 925 & 926.  This FAD is reported older (10.57 Ma) in cycle-calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean.   Wade et al. (2011) expound further: "The cyclostratraphic age of the LO of Neogloboquadrina acostaensis (9.83 Ma) is derived from Ceara Rise (Chaisson and Pearson, 1997). This calibration was adopted by Lourens et al. (2004) and is significantly younger (1.07 myr) than in Berggren et al. (1995a) (10.90 Ma) and would move this event from early Subchron C5n.2n to Subchron C5n.1n. Turco et al. (2002) noted the diachrony of the LO of Neogloboquadrina acostaensis between low latitudes and the Mediterranean.  The age used in Berggren et al. (1995a) is calibrated to the magnetostratigraphy at Site 563 (Miller et al., 1985) and the discrepancy in calibrated ages may be due to further diachrony between the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, however, we note that the order of bioevents is consistent between Ceara Rise and Site 563."

The cycle tuned age from the Mediterranean is here preferred.
	Globoturborotalita nepenthes	11.63		Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 foram appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) notes that 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes' FAD occurs in North Atlantic Sites 563 and 608 and basal Buff Bay Fm., Jamaica = C5r.3r; 11.8 Ma = C5r.3r.3. The astronomically calibrated age is here favored.  They also use this FAD to define base of Medit. Zone Mt8.  
	Fohsella robusta	13.13		Formerly called 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta'.  Wade et al'11 on Fohsella lineage:  "Taxonomic subdivision of this gradual chronocline into species and subspecies is inevitably subjective".   Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta' FAD is based on revised interpretation of magnetostratigraphy of Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies in ref.o = C5An.2n; 12.3 Ma = C5An.2n.5.
	Fohsella fohsi	13.41		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia.  [Wade et al'11 on Fohsella lineage:  "Taxonomic subdivision of this gradual chronocline into species and subspecies is inevitably subjective".]  Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) assign Miocene foram 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str.' FAD is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy at Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies at Holes 747A and 608 = C5Ar.n1-2 (undiff.); 12.7 Ma = C5Ar.2r.8.
	Fohsella "praefohsi	13.77		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia.  The form 'Gt. praefohsi' seems intermediate between 'Gt. peripheroacuta' and 'Gt. fohsi s.str'.   Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926. Berggren et al (1995) assigned  'Globorotalia praefohsi' FAD to a much younger level, based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy at North Atlantic Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies at Holes 747A and 608 (Wright & Miller, 1992) = C5Ar.n1-2 (undiff.) = placed here at Chron C5Ar.2r.8. Note  this North Atlantic FAD age-assignment was nearly identical to FAD of 'Gt. fohsi s.str.'
	Fohsella peripheroacuta	14.24		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia, and was used by Berggren et al (1995) to define base of Serravalian stage.  Astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- summarized in Lourens et al., GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al (1995) assigned as C5B.1n; 14.8 Ma = base C5ADr = nearly 0.5 myr older than Atlantic-ODP cycle-strat assignment.
	Orbulina suturalis	15.1		Wade et al'11 "Because of the rarity of Orbulina at the beginning of its range at Ceara Rise (Pearson and Chaisson, 1997) we have retained the age estimate from BKSA95."  Table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis" -- that FAD was 14.73 Ma based on astronomically tuned from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6.
	Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str.	16.27		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 (Lourens et al., 2004).  Berggren et al (1995a) uses to define base of Medit. Zone Mt5b, and assign to C5Cn.1n (upper) in South Atlantic Hole 516 DSDP Leg 72; 16.1 Ma = C5Cn.1n.8.  Berggren et al. (1985a) writes: "FAD Praeorbulina glomerosa occurs in Hole 516 [South Atlantic DSDP Leg 72] about 15 m below FAD Orbulina suturalis in an interval with no paleomagnetic data and about 5 m above FAD P. sicana in mid-part of Chron C5CN (Berggren et al., 1983)" 
	Praeorbulina sicana	16.38		Age of 16.97 Ma was estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (2004) -- however this implied revised calibration to polarity chrons would seem to invert Medit. zones Mt4b and Mt5a of Berggren et al. (1995a).  Berggren et al. (1995a) assign age as Chron C5Cn.2n (mid) and write: "LAD P. sicana occurs in interval of no paleomagnetic data about 20 m above FAD P. sicana which occurs in anom. 5C correlative in Hole 516 (Berggren et al., 1983)." Wade et al. (2011) write: 'Praeorbulina taxa are rare at Ceara Rise (Pearson and Chaisson, 1997) and therefore were not included in the revised calibration, and we have retained the ages reported in Berggren et al. (1995a) for FAD Orbulina suturalis (15.1 Ma), FAD Praeorbulina circularis, (16.0 Ma), FAD Praeorbulina curva (16.3 Ma) and Praeorbulina sicana (16.4 Ma)." We tentatively follow the Wade et al. (2011) assessment until further sites are investigated.
	Globigeriantella insueta s.str.	17.59		Age estimated from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix) -- Note that this is much higher FAD than estimated calibrations by Berggren et al. (1995a); which results in Zone M3 being nearly non-existent.  Berggren et al. (1995a) -- 'Globigerinatella insueta' FAD has an inferred correlation to base of Chron C5En.
	Globigerinatella sp.	19.3		Age estimated from South Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix)
	Globoquadrina dehiscens	22.44		Wade et al'11 astrochronology age projects as essentially Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995), who used to define Medit. Zone Mt1b -- Miocene foram 'Globoquadrina dehiscens' FAD is recorded in Holes 516F, 558, 563 (ref. b); South Atlantic (refs. r,s) and Contessa Highway Section (ref. q) = C6Br; 23.2 Ma [b] or 23.4 Ma [u] = C6Br.5.
	Paragloborotalia" kugleri	22.96		Paragloborotalia is the temporary genus assignment by Wade et al'11 -- is Globorotalia in some publications.  FAD Paragloborotalia kugleri s.str. = M1 base; and approx. Oligocene/Miocene boundary.  Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926; in Lourens et al. (GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix).  Berggren et al (1995a) notes that 'Globorotalia kugleri' FAD is recorded in Holes 558, 563 (North Atlantic) and 516F (South Atlantic) = base of Chron C6Cn.2n.
	Paragloborotalia" pseudokugleri	25.21		Wade et al'11 astrochronology age projects chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- 'Paragloborotalia (formerly Globorotalia) pseudokugleri' FAD recorded in polarity zone C8n in Hole 803D (Ontong Java Plateau) and in C7n in Hole 628A (Little Bahama Bank) = placed at Chron C8n.1n.3. Therefore, Chron-link retained here.
	Globigerina angulisuturalis	29.18		Berggren and Pearson (2005) estimate is similar to Berggren et al. (1995a) chron-age -- 'Globoturborotalita (formerly Globigerina) angulisuturalis' FAD, which defines base of P21a, is recorded by Berggren and Miller (1988) in South Atlantic Hole 516, North Atlantic Holes 558, 628A and west equatorial Pacific Site 803C.  Their 29.4 Ma age was the top of Chron C11n on their polarity scale.
	Orbulinoides beckmanni	40.49		Defines P13 (= E12) base.  Wade et al. (2011) has same  chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a), which is Chron C18r.66 on their polarity scale.
	Globigerinatheka kugleri	43.88		DASHED -- Wade et al. (2011): "The age of the LO [FAD] of Globigerinatheka kugleri in not well constrained and there is a significant need for further study of this interval in continuous sections with magnetostratigraphy".  They project as 43.4 Ma relative to GTS04 polarity => Chron C20r.75. Wade et al. (2011) reference the Tanzania study (Indian Ocean) by Pearson et al. (2004).
	Guembelitrioides nuttalli	45.72	dotted	FAD of G. nuttalli (which is NOT the same as Hantkenina nuttalli) is dashed at approximately the base of Chron C21r (or may be ca. 0.2 myr lower at C21n.9 or C21n.8, if use the Lutetian GSSP publication in Episodes, 2011, based on Payros et al., 2009) and is the base of revised zone E8 (Wade et al., 2011).  This datum-chron correlation is nearly 3 million years higher than in Berggren & Pearson (2005).  Wade et al. (2011) summarize: "In a detailed magnetobiostratigraphic study of an expanded lower-middle Eocene succession from the western Pyrenees, Payros et al. (2009) examined the divergence of planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 and the standard zonation (BKSA95). Unlike BKSA95 which places the boundary between planktonic foraminiferal Zones P9 and P10 within calcareous nannofossil Zone NP14 (Subzone CP12a) and magnetic polarity Chron C22n/C21r boundary, they found the boundary to occur within Zone NP15 (=Zone CP13) and Chron C20r.  ... The P9/P10 zonal boundary is therefore a surprising 3.1 myr younger than in BKSA95."  In addition, the first occurrence of Hantkenina (alternate suggested marker for base of P10), which had been a working definition of base of Lutetian Stage, was found to be significantly higher (possibly near the top of Chron C20r; ca. another 2 myr higher).  Calibration of these events needs further careful study.   [In contrast, the age assignment of these events, hence base-Lutetian, by Berggren and Pearson (2005) was 49.0 Ma = Base C21r.]
	Turborotalia frontosa	48.31		T. frontosa FAD (Base of Zone E7b) is "one of most signficant foraminifer events in Middle/Early Eocene boundary interval; and occurs 13 precession cycles (0.26 myr) above base of C21r at the Lutetian GSSP section (Lutetian GSSP; published in Episodes, 2011).  [Wade et al. (2011) table has an age of 48.6 Ma; but this would project only the base of that Chron C21r on their polarity time scale.]
	Acarinina cuneicamerata	50.2		Acarinina cuneicamerata = base E7, Planorotalites ("Astrorotalia" in some publications) palmerae = base P9.  Chron-age calibration by Berggren et al. (1995a): their 50.4 Ma is at Chron C22r.33 on their polarity scale. Wade et al. (2011) cites Hancock et al. (2002) Exmouth Plateau study.
	Morozovella aragonensis	52.54		Defines P7 (=E5) base. Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- 'Morozovella argonensis' FAD is recorded in North Atlantic Hole 550, North Pacific Shatsky Rise Hole 577 and in Chron C23r in South Atlantic (Walvis Ridge) Hole 527.  Their 52.3 Ma age is at Chron C23r.1 on their polarity scale.  [NOTE: The Wade et al. (2011) table based on Berggren-Pearson (2005) lists the same 52.3 Ma, which suggests they didn't convert to the chron-ages of the GTS04 magnetic scale.]
	Morozovella  formosa	54.61		Base of Zone P6b (= Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson. 2005).  This taxon is called only "Moro. formosa" in some other charts and papers, and was called Globorotalia formosa in some publications.  Wade et al. (2011) projects as Chron C24r.8, which is similar chron-age calibration by Berggren et al. (1995a) -- 'Morozovella formosa formosa' FAD is calibrated in North Pacific Shatsky Rise Hole 577.
	Pseudohastigerina wilcoxensis	55.81		Berggren and Pearson (2005) -- FAD is top (not base) of PETM carbon-isotope excursion.  Wade et al. (2011) show PETM as having ca. 0.1 myr duration (rounded).  Following offset used by Berggren and Pearson (2007) and Wade et al. (2011), this FAD is set as 0.15 myr above PE boundary (base of PETM).
	Acarinina sibaiyaensis	55.96		Berggren and Pearson (2005): marker for Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  One of "Excursion taxa" at PE boundary, therefore age is set equal to that PE age = lower-mid Chron C24r.
	Acarinina soldadoensis	57.79		Paleocene foram 'Acarinina soldadoensis' FAD defines base of Zone P4c of Berggren et al. (1995).  Berggren and Pearson (2005) has same chron-age calibration (Chron C25r.9) as Berggren et al. (1995) -- This datum is calibrated in DSDP Hole 384; and at comparable levels but without paleomagnetic control in Holes 465 and 758A, in association with FAD of Acar. coalingensis-triplex group and Acar. soldadoensis.  
	Globanomalina pseudomenardii	60.73		Summary calibration by Berggren and Pearson (2005) corresponds to Chron C26r.5 on their polarity scale.  Berggren et al. (1995a) had assigned it about 0.2 myr younger within that Chron C26r.  Calibration in Hole 384 (N. Atlantic), and at comparable levels but without paleomagnetic control in Holes 465 (Eq. Pacific) and 758A (Indian Ocean) in Berggren et al. (1995a).  The FAD is also recorded in the younger part of Chron C26r in Hole 577 (North Pacific) within Nannofossil Zone CP 5/6 (undiff.); but in Hole 685 (Eastern Equatorial Pacific) it is recorded within Chron C25r in Zone CP5 (= basal C25r) and in Hole 605 (North Atlantic) within C26n in Zone CP5 (= NP5). [ Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina psudomenardii' was called 'Planorotalites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).]
	Igorina albeari	61.33		Igorina albeari (=Muricella albeari = Globorotalia laevigata) FAD defines base of zone P3b.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) has same chron-age calibration (Chron C26r.3) as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- This FAD occurs approximately mid-way in Zone P3 in Holes 463 (Eq. Pacific) and 758A (Indian Ocean) and in the mid-Chron C26r in Hole 384 (North Atlantic).  Their 60.0 Ma age corresponds to Chron C26r.3 on their polarity scale.
	Morozovella angulata	62.29		Former working definition for base of Selandian stage.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) has same chron-age calibration (ca. Chron C27n.8) as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- Paleocene foram 'Morozovella angulata' FAD occurs in Hole 384 (North Atlantic) in upper C27n at <2m above FAD of 'P. uncinata') in Nannofossil Zone NP4.  In Holes 465 (Eq. Pacific) and 758A (Indian Ocean) it is 2m above FAD of 'P. uncinata'.  In Hole 577 (N. Pacific) within lower part of Chron C26r, but precise position difficult to determine because of absence of C27n (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86).  Chron assignment = C27n (upper; placed here as C27n.8).
	Praemurica uncinata	62.6		Praemurica uncinata' (formerly 'Morozovella uncinata') FAD defines base of Zone P2.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) moved the FAD 0.4 myr older than in Berggren et al. (1995), who had an extended discussion of calibration problems in different sites.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) summary age assignment of 61.37 Ma corresponds to Chron C27r.92 on their polarity scale.   [NOTES from Berggren et al. (1995) -- The FAD occurs in Hole 577 (refs. a,e) just above a N->R polarity reversal (= polarity chron C28n); but Polarity chron C27n is missing (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86: p.446, Fig. 5; p.449, Fig 7B), and there may be a short hiatus at/near the level if FAD of this taxon in C27n (ref. b) is correct.  Alternatively C27n may be missing in the core break between cores 11 and 12 (ca. 101.8 m) in which case the FO of this taxon would be near the C27r/C28n boundary (see ref. b).  In Hole 384, it occurs at the same level as FAD of 'P. praeangulata' in Nannofossil Zone NP4 at the base of C27n, as well as in Holes 465 and 758A (see extended discussion in Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).  Its FAD was considered equivalent to FAD of 'Praemurica praecursoria' (= 'Globorotalia (Acarinina) praecursoria' of Berggren & Miller, 1988) in an earlier draft by Berggren (1993), but 'praecursoria' was removed from his later versions. Chron assignment = C27n (lower); 61.2 Ma [a,b]; but 61.37 Ma (uppermost C27r) in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C27r.92.]
	Globanomalina compressa	63.9		Wade et al. (2011) assigned as Chron C28n.65 on their polarity scale, following Berggren and Pearson (2005) and Berggren et al. (1995a): 'Praemurica inconstans' FAD is recorded in Southern Ocean Holes 689B and 690C and North Atlantic Hole 384 in mid-C28n. It also occurs at a comparable level (by correlation) in an interval with no polarity data just above incomplete polarity chron C28n in Indian Ocean Hole 750A.   [Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina compressa' was called 'Planorotalites compresus' in Berggren & Miller, (1988). Berggren & Miller (1988) "believe that G. compressus and Morozovella trinidadensis have approximately coeval FAD's"; therefore, this FAD of compressa was also base of Zone P1c.]
	Subbotina triloculinoides	65.25		Defines base of zone P1b.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a) --  'Subbotina triloculinoides' FAD is recorded in Hole 384 (North Atlantic).  Their 64.3 Ma age corresponds to Chron C29n.6 on their polarity scale.
	Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina	66		Defines base of Pa ('alpha' Greek letter).  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995a) -- "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina" FAD is estimated at about 0.03 myr after the end-Cretaceous event based on Spanish sections in Groot et al., (1990), discussed in Berggren, 1995a).  Wade et al. (2011) assign a 0.04 myr duration for basal zone P0 (used here).
	Pseudoguembelina hariaensis	67.3		Pseudoguembelina hariaensis Zone (FAD of species) of Caron'95 recommended by Huber et al'08.  Base is mid-Chron 30n (DASHED at 66.78 Ma by Huber et al'08 => C30n.5.
	Abathomphalus mayaroensis	69.18		A. mayaroensis zone begins at base of Chron C31n (summarized by Huber et al'08; and their corrected age of 68.66 => C31n.1).  GTS04 had used a slightly higher Chron C31n.40 (ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995).  This is the Tethyan FAD.  The FAD of A. mayaroensis seems to be older in North Sea (Paul Sikora, EGI database, 2005).  SEPM'98 correlation was approx. top of J. nebrascansis ammonite zone.
	Racemiguembelina fructicosa	70.14	dashed	DASHED (diachronous):  Upper third of Chron C31r (Huber et al'08; who interpolate age of 69.62 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics => C31r.6).This is same as Chron C31r.60  in ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995; which is nearly same as the C31r.66 placement in SEPM98).  NOTE: However, this FAD in Tethyan realm is calibrated in EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) as 67.5 Ma (2 myr young), which is ABOVE the FAD of A. mayaroensis => this Zone may not be applicable.  "Latitudinal diachroneity" (later FAD in Chron C31n at DSDP 525; Li and Keller, 1998) cited by Huber et al'08.  
	Pseudoguembelina palpabra	71.75		P. palpebra zone added by Huber et al'08 "because recognition of the G. gansseri and G. aegyptiaca zones is deemed unreliable (at least at Leg 207 Blake Nose sites).  Base is "upper Chron C32n.1r" (Brian Huber, written commun., Sept 11) -- used here as C32n.1r.75 and FAD of Nannofossil T. phacelosus (base of CC24, in their version), although their projected 71.64 Ma "relative to GTS04 magnetics" implies C32n.2n.9 which is 0.3 myr lower.  This useful datum is tabulated in EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005), with age derived from composite standard (1998 time scale) -- their implied age is 72% up in Chron C32n.2n.
	Gansserina gansseri	72.97	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 (and SEPM'98) places at Chron C32n.2n.40; following Premoli and Sliter (1994); and Brian Huber advised to dash it.
	Globotruncana aegyptiaca	74	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 (and SEPM'98) places at Chron C32r.1n.50 according to their interpolation (73.27 Ma, relative to GTS04 magnetics), although their text says "C32r.2r.5.  However, EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) calibrates Glob. aegyptiaca FAD at 72.7 Ma; about 0.5 myr younger.
	Radotruncana calcarata	76.18		Calcarata was previously assigned to genus Globotruncanita.  Polarity chron C33n.66 (Huber et al'08 although text accidentally says "C33n.76"; SEPM).  Genus assigned as "Radotruncana" in Leg 171B table, but not in their Figure.
	Contusotruncana plummerae	79.2		Zone of C. plummerae replaced G. ventricosa (due to rarity of that basal marker) by Petrizzo et al., 2011.  Calbrated as 78.8 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics by them, hence C33n.125 (1/8th up in Zone).  Formerly called Globotruncana fornicata Plummer subsp. plummerae.
	Globotruncanita elevata	83.64		Base of Campanian in SEPM'98.
	Dicarinella asymetrica	86.66	dashed	DASHED -- D. asymtrica Zone is also range-zone of the index species. Current base-Santonian GSSP proposal (Spanish section) implies that this level would be in upper Coniacian.  Coniacian-Santonian boundary interval section of Ten Mile Creek (Gale et al., 2007) suggest ca. 75% up in S. depressus Ammonite Zone or lower.  In contrast, SEPM'98 assigns as Base of Middle Santonian (= base C. vermiformis ammonite zone). 
	Dicarinella concavata	91.08	dashed	Dashed -- One-third up in P. hyatti ammonite zone in SEPM98 (hence about 2 myr below base-Coniacian); but ODP Leg 171B placed about 0.8 myr higher (used here, on advice of Brian Huber, written comm., Sept 11), therefore shifted to Base of S. ferronensis ammonite zone,
	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	93.52	dashed	DASH (Petrizzo advises this).  Base of H. helvetica is just above top of W. devonense ammonite zone (UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011); so put as 1/3rd up in P. flexuosum zone here.  SEPM 98 had equivalent to the Top of W. devonense ammonite zone (= base of P. flexuosum ammonite zone) on SEPM'98 chart.
	Rotalipora cushmani	95.94		SEPM'98 places at mid-point of Acanthoceras muldoonense ammonite zone. See note on R. reicheli.
	Thalmanninella reicheli	96.08		Formerly called "Rotalipora reicheli".  SEPM'98 assigns as base of Middle Cenomanian.   Leg 171B table assigns the R. reicheli Zone with an age ~1 myr older, but with same duration.
	Thalmanninella globotruncanoides	100.5		Formerly "Rotalipora globotruncanoides".  Base of Cenomanian (= primary marker of GSSP !! ).  Formerly called "R. greenhornensis"?  SEPM'98 had assigned as latest Albian (mid-point of uppermost subzone, M. perinflatum), but this was prior to GSSP definition of boundary.
	Parathalmanninella appenninica	101.92		Formerly "Rotalipora appenninica".  Base of planktonic foraminifer Rotalipora appenninica is nearly the same horizon as base of Planomalina buxtorfi = base of that zone = 3.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (1.3 myr) => 100.9 Ma.  Leckie et al. (2002) indicate that R. appenninica FAD is just slightly older/below the FAD of P. buxtorfi, but Hardenbol et al. (1998) and Bellier et al., (2000) show the events to be simultaneous, which I will assume here.  The duration is 1.3 myr, nearly identical to the 1.5 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002) and 1.1 myr in Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Considering the thickness at Risou for this R. appenninica zone (in excess of 100 m; Kennedy et al., 2003 in press), I would have preferred a much longer time span.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Stoliczkaia dispar Zone.
	Planomalina buxtorfi	101.92		FAD = 3.5 cycles of 405 kyr at Piobbico and Col de Palluel (Grippo et al, 2004; Gale et al., 2011).  See below (primary control on Albian scale!).  Base of P. buxtorfi is also used as base of R. appenninica Zone on some scales.
	Pseudothalmanninella ticinensis	103.94		Formerly "Rotalipora ticinensis".  Base of zone = 8.5 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (3.3 myr) on Piobbico and Col de Palleul cyclostratigraphy (Grippo et al., 2004; Gale et al., 2011) => 102.9 Ma.   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/5 from base of H. varicosum s.z.
	Pseudothalmanninella subticinensis	106.98	dashed	Formerly "Rotalipora subticinensis".  DASH:  SEPM'98 had assigned as FAD is at the base of the H. orbignyi s.z. of the M. (M.) inflatum. (used here).   Base of foraminifer R. subticinensis (base of that subzone) is not indicated in this Piobbico cyclostratigraphy, but Leckie et al. (2002) scales it within the B. breggiensis zone as 0.7 myr below the base of R. ticinensis, which would project as 103.6 Ma in GTS04, but would lose the relative proportions of Leckie's scale.
	Ticinella praeticinensis	107.39		Base of T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone  = 17 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (6.8 myr) => 106.4 Ma.  The duration is 3.2 myr, nearly the same as the 3.3 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002).  (NOTE -- Leckie et al., 2002, define the T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone as the base of B. breggiensis Zone, in turn defined by the base of that species; however, the actual FAD of T. praeticinensis is below/older than the base of B. breggiensis according to both Leckie et al., 2002, and Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Because Premoli Silva is a co-author on both the Leckie et al., 2002 paper and on the Piobbico cycle stratigraphy paper, I'm assuming that the T. praeticinensis subzone is defined as base of B. breggiensis for this scaling.  In contrast, the zonal schemes of Hardenbol et al., 1998, and Bellier et al., 2000, do not have a B. breggiensis zone, but define the base of T. praeticinensis zone by the first occurrence of the name species.  What a mess.)  (primary control on Albian scale!)
	Ticinella primula	111.84		Base of foraminifer T. primula is 28 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (11.3 myr) in Piobbico cyclestrat => 110.9 Ma.  The T. primula zone extends up to 106.4 Ma, which is consistent with the 107.1 Ma Ar-Ar age within it (but from the middle of the 3 ammonite zones that it spans) obtained by Obradovich (1993).   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had placed in middle of O. raulinianus s.z.
	Ticinella madecassiana	112.4	dotted	New zone replacing upper H.planispira (Huber-Leckie'11).  DOTTED at middle of former zone.
	Microhedbergella rischi	112.96	dashed	Could be a definition for the base-Albian (easy to recognize).  Huber-Leckie's estimated 300 kyr interval above LAD of P. eubejaouaensis (used here); but Huber (pers. comm., Sept 2011) implied that it should be shorter.  "accompanied, within a short stratigraphic thickness, by the extinction of several other Aptian hedbergellids, including Hd. infracretacea, Hd. occulta, Hd. gorbachikae, and Hd. excelsa, as well as Gl. aptiensis. Species diversity is very low," (Huber-Leckie, 2011)
	Microhedbergella renilaevis	113.14		Middle of Kilian level (hence, about 31.1 cycles below base-Cenomanian).  Mi renilaevis co-occurs with common Mi. miniglobularis at ODP-DSDP sites in S. Atlantic, North Atlantic and Indian Ocean; therefore is an important marker.
	Microhedbergella miniglobularis	113.26		The FAD of this "new genera" Microhedbergella is when P. eubejaouaensis vanishes. M. miniglobularis zone is a brief zone from "25 cm above LAD of P. eubejaouaensis" spanning 2 meters to the middle of the Kilian level in SE France (Petrizzo et al., Newsletters on Stratigraphy, 2011 in press).
	Paraticinella eubejaouaensis	118.02		Base (formerly called Ticinella bejaouaensis) = 43 1/4 cycles (of 405 kyr) at Piobbico cycle strat (Huang et al., 2010).  In GTS04 was 114.6 Ma (was 114.3 in Leckie's chart) [but table now has 114.3].  SEPM'98 had estimated as 3/5 up in D. nodosocostatum s.z.
	Globigerinelloides algerianus	122.17		Base Globigerinelloides algerianus = 53.5 cycles of 0.405 below base-Cenomaniann at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 119.0 Ma (was 117.1 on Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 3/5 from base of martinoides Zone.
	Leupoldina cabri (consistent)	123.89		Consistent L. cabri (and calibration of FAD in SE France, etc.) is 57.75 cycles of 405kyr below base-Cenomanian at Piobbico (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 85% up in D. deshayesi Zone (but see comment below -- rare occurrences are nearly to base of Aptian).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/3 from base of Deshayesites deshayesi Zone.
	Leupoldina cabri (rare)	125.71		Base L. cabri (after downward extension by Premoli Silva et al., 1999) = rare L.cabri = 62.25 cycles of 405kyr below base of Cenomanian at Piobbico (just below base of Selli OAE1a) (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = 0.5 myr above base Aptian (125.0 Ma) = 124.5 Ma  (but, usually rare until higher; therefore the apparent FAD of L. cabri in the middle of the D. deshayesi ammonite zone in the Bedoule section (Moullade et al., 1998) is probably this delayed first occurrence).
	Globigerinelloides blowi	128.73		SEPM'98 had assigned as Estimated as about 1/4 below top of A. vandenheckii zone.
	Hedbergella similis	130.37		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of N. nicklesi Zone.
	Hedbergella sigali/delrioensis	134.22		SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 myr above mid-H. trinodosum s.z.   Most scales list this as H. sigali Foram Zone.
	Globuligerina hoterivica	141.93		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of M. paraminounum s.z.   Also called "Favusella" hoterivica
	Conoglobigerina gulekhensis	145.95		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Berriasian

	NN21	0.29		Pleistocene Nanno Zone NN21 may possibly be subdivided further:  Acme of E. huxleyi; LAD Pontosphaera indooceanica; and dominance reversal of G. caribbeanica / E. huxleyi.  The latter event occurs earlier in tropical-subtropical waters (ﾶO18 stage 5b&5a) than in transitional (ﾶO18 stage 4) (Thierstein et al., 1977).  The FAD of Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and G. muellerae approximates the base of NN21.  [From summary in Perch-Nielsen, 1985; Plankton Stratigraphy]
	NN20	0.44		LAD defines top of NN19, therefore at base of NN20.  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 & 138) and Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  Age is recorded slightly older (0.47 myr) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) placed similaly = O-18 stage 12; Chron C1n.4. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN19	1.93		Pleistocene Nanno Zone NN19 can be subdivided by: FAD of G. caribbeanica; LAD of C. macintyrei and of H. sellii, and FAD of G. oceanica (see CN13 subzonation)
	NN18	2.39		LAD of D. pentaradiatus (quintatus) defines top of NN17, therefore at base of NN18.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded earlier (2.51 Ma) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) places near Matuyama/Gauss boundary, or at about Chron C2r.3r.25.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN17	2.49		LAD of D. surculus defines top of NN16, therefore at base of NN17.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (2.52 Ma and 2.54 Ma) in Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 and in eastern Mediterranean, respectively.  Berggren et al. (1995b) place near Matuyama/Gauss boundary at about Chron C2r.3r.1.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN16	3.7		This LAD defines top of NN15, therefore at base of NN16.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (3.79 Ma and 3.84 Ma) in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138) and in eastern Mediterranean, respectively.  Acccording to Berggren et al. (1995b), Pliocene nannofossil Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus (LAD) occurs in Mediterranean at about Chron C2Ar.7 (uppermost part of upper-reversed interval of Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN15	3.92		Formerly "Discoaster" tricornicultus.  Mid-way between D. asymmetricus FAD & R. pseudoumbilicus LAD in the schematic chart of Berggren et al. (1995b).  Not assigned an age in Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2).
	NN14	4.13		Pliocene Nanno Zones NN13 and NN14 are often merged to NN13/NN14, because D. asymmetricus marker is often rare or difficult to identify (Martini, 1980).
	NN13	5.12		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138). This FAD is reported later (5.05 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  In Berggren et al. (1995b), this datum is diachronous among regions -- Pliocene nannofossil Cerotolithus rugosus (FAD) occurs near top of Nunivak (4.5 Ma) in Mediterranean, but within Thvera (about Chron C3n.4n.5); 5.0-5.23 Ma in oceanic areas. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN12	5.59		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138); and reported at same time (5.58 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren. Kent, et al. (1995) assign as middle of Chron C3r (Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	alt NN11a	8.11		From Leg 145 compilation indicates either in Chron C4 or the base of Chron C4n.2n (for older FAD estimate; used here). [ODP Leg 145 Shipboard Scientific Party (1993); not in Aubry's synthesis in Berggren et al. (1995)]
	NN11	8.29		Miocene Nannofossil Zone NN11 begins with either the FAD of D. berggreni (an earlier event) or of D. quinqueramus; the definition problem arises depending if these two taxa are considered to be the same species.  Bukry (1981) defined Zone CN8b beginning with FAD of D. neorectus and/or FAD of D. loeblichii, and ending with FAD of D. surculus; but these events are not calibrated in the scales of Berggren (in prep, SEPM) or Leg 145.  Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995) indicates that FAD of D. berggrenii defines base of both NN11 and CN9; and this placement is shown in this chart.
	NN10	9.53		Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean.  LAD occurs slightly earlier (9.69 Ma) at Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Astronomical age implies approximately Chron C4Ar.2r.5. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Correlations, as indicated by Berggren et al. (1995) were inconsistent; with younger LADs being reported elsewhere in previous literature -- C4Ar.2r.5; 9.4 Ma; or C4A; 8.67 Ma or 9.37 Ma; therefore C4Ar.2r.5 seems best estimate (nearly same as astronomical tuning).
	NN9	10.55		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  FAD occurs much younger (10.18 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.   [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Berggren et al. (1995a) note that this datum is "controversial" and inconsistent, with different reported correlations to magnetostratigraphy.  More checks on this calibration are needed.
	NN8	10.89		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  FAD occurs slightly later (10.73 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Very poorly constrained age, and Atlantic may be 0.4 m.y. before Pacific -- Berggren et al. (1995) give C5r.2r (Atl.); 11.3 Ma or 11.1 Ma; therefore an older placement (by 0.4 myr) of C5r.2r.5 was used on previous versions of this chart.
	NN7	11.9		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926); and simultaneous (11.90 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)].  This "FCO" of Lourens et al. (2004) seems to correspond in calibration to the "FAD" of Berggren et al. (1995a), which they summarized as approximately lower Chron C5r.3r.
	NN6	13.53		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926); but LAD is reported slightly earlier (13.654 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  The offset, although only 100 kyr, causes a problem, because this nannofossil S. heteromorphus LAD had been a candidate for the "primary marker" for base-Serravallian GSSP as placed in the in the Mediterranean region.  Berggren et al. (1995a) had a similar chron-age assignment of approximately Chron C5ABr.6. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	NN5	14.91		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]   Berggren et al. (1995a) had placed this LAD about 0.6 myr older as middle of Chron C5Br.
	NN4	17.95		Lourens et al (2004) assign this event as a LCO that is astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]   This is only slightly above the LAD, which was the original definition of the zone (a 0.1 myr difference according to J. Bergen, pers. commun., 2005).
	NN3	18.28		Berggren et al (1995) had shown FAD of S. belemnos as defining base of CN2.  But Lourens et al (2004) assign base-CN2 as equivalent to base NN3.  Actually, Young et al'98 consider S. belemnos to be the better marker.
	NN2	22.82		B Discoaster druggi (sensu stricto) -- Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean (based on projecting astronomical tuning of long-period minima to base-Miocene), which is consistent with ODP Leg 154.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  However, smaller forms appear earlier, at end of Oligocene (J. Bergen and E. de Kaenel, pers. commun., 2005).  FAD has been assigned to C6Cn in Leg 145 compilation, but Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995) assigns 0.5 m.y. higher (in C6Br); so earlier chart had used C6Br.5.
	NN1	23.13		The LAD of 'R. bisectus' was used to approximate the NP25/NN1 boundary in high latitudes, but proved useful for global; and was "substituted for H. recta, the marker of the NP15/NN1 boundary in Martini's (1971) zonal scheme" by Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995).
	NP25	26.84		Oligocene Nanno 'Sphenolithus distentus' LAD  is cycle-calibrated as 26.81 Ma (3.78 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is younger than chron-age of C9n by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995) at 27.5 Ma, but is consistent with mid-Chron C8n.2n correlation in Leg 145 table.  The LCO was placed in Chron 9n in basal-Chattian compilation of Italian sections by Coccioni et al. (GSA Bull, 2008).
	NP24	29.62	dashed	DASH -- Difficult to pin down age within the transition; therefore has a wide range fo calibrations.    Cycle-calibrated as 27.14 Ma (4.11 myr relative to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al.'09 (Eq. Pac.); but Paul Bown (to J.Ogg, June'11) advised to not use this very high placement, because this might be a very high level in the transition.  Nanno 'Sphenolithus ciperoensis FAD' is assigned by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995) within Subchron C11n.2n; but was placed at essentially base of Chron C11n.2n at proposed Chattian GSSP (Coccioni et al., GSA Bull., 2008).  However, to avoid overlap with cycle-scaled "underlying" CP18 marker, the base of this NP24/CP19 is set slightly higher at Chron C11n.2n.8.  This is about 1.3 myr older than estimate in Leg 145 table. [Berggren et al. (1995a); Coccioni et al. (2008); P. Bown (pers. comm., 2011)]
	NP23	32.02	dashed	Diachronous -- Oligocene Nanno 'Reticulofenestra umbilicus LAD' was specified as ">14 micron" in Leg 145 table.  This LAD occurs earlier (32.3 Ma) in low-mid latitudes than in southern high-latitudes (31.3 Ma) = 1m.y. diachroneity.  For simplicity, I have placed the associated Zone NP23; CP17 base with the mid-latitude level (32.3 Ma).
	NP22	32.92		Also known as "Ericsonia formosa".  Diachronous (Berggren et al. (1995a) indicate the LAD is 7 myr nearly earlier in south high lat!).  Cycle-calibrated as 32.92 Ma (9.89 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is same as chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) as revised by Leg 145 = lowermost Chron C12r.
	NP21	34.44	dashed	Diachronous.  Cycle-calibrated as 34.44 Ma (11.41 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is consistent with the chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) as revised by Leg 145 = middle of Chron C13r.
	NP19-20	36.97		Zone NP19-20 has definition problems -- Eocene Nanno Zone NP19-20 is combined in most zonations, because base of NP20 (FAD Sphenolithus pseudoradians) was later found to be a very resticted taxon with a time-transgressive FAD (as early as NP15!).  Base of Zone NP19-20 redefined by Aubry to be FAD of 'I. recurvus', rather than LAD of 'C. grandis'.  [Reviewed in Perch-Nielsen, 1985].  The LAD of 'C. grandis' (Martini, 1976, definition) would appear to be more useful?
	NP18	37.32		Genus 'Chiasmolithus' is rare in low latitudes, so NP17 and NP18 are often combined.  NP 17/18 boundary = Working definition for Middle/Late Eocene boundary.
	NP17	40.4		Genus 'Chiasmolithus' is rare in low latitudes, so NP17 and NP18 are often combined.
	NP16	42.87	dashed	DASH -- Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as middle of Chron C20n.5.  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 43.4 Ma based on Bachman (1986), but chron-age not given.  Base of NP16 was LAD of B. gladius, but rarely preserved (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June2011); therefore IODP Leg 320-321 used LAD of N. fulgens as proxy => NP15 becomes the Range Zone of N. fulgens.
	NP15	46.29		Eocene Nanno Zone NP15-16 is combined in some zonal schemes, because marker of NP16 (base = LAD 'Rhabdolithus gladius') is rare or often absent.  [See Perch-Nielsen, 1985, for details.]   However, Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), could distinquish 3 subzones in NP15 using markers similar for subzones of CP13 (with a total duration of 4 m.y.), and estimated that NP16 was a valid zone with duration of nearly 3 m.y.
	NP14	49.11		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 49.5 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2006) => Chron C21n.3 on that scale; used here.  This is just slightly younger than the chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of base of C22n.  The Lutetian GSSP nannofossils (Molina et al., Episodes, in press as of 2011) indicate the FAD may be as high as C21n.5.5.
	NP13	50.5		DASH (CP11 only) -- Eocene Nanno Zone CP11 base is FAD of Toweius? crassus; and this event is often used to approximate base of NP13 (see discussion in Perch-Nielsen, 1985).  Following Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), NP13 and CP11 bases are made coeval, but there is no direct CP11 calibration.
	NP12	53.7		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 53.1 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C24n.3n.5 (used here).  This is about 0.25 older than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of the middle of Chron C24n.2r.
	NP11	54.17	dashed	DASH -- LAD of T. contortus is not seen very often, therefore Leg 320-321 (PEAT) used FAD of Tri. orthostylus as alternate marker for base-NP11.  Eocene Nanno Zone NP11 is essentially a "gap" zone, recognized by absence of NP10 or NP12 zonal markers.
	NP10	55.86		Base of NP10 is in uppermost Paleocene -- Eocene/Paleocene boundary nanno "Tribrachiatus bramlettei" is assigned to top of Paleocene by Aubrey (in Berggren et al., 1995); but Leg 145 placed it about 2 m.y. higher in lower Eocene.  This is often equated with base of CP9 (FAD of Discoaster diastypus), but there is no direct calibration.  Indeed, Leg 145 table implies about 1.0 m.y. separation (although, this is probably not a direct estimate).
	NP9	57.21		Zone NP9 spans Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  Paleocene Nanno Zone NP9 contains FAD's of several Discoaster species and other groups; producing a peak in nannofossil diversity.  Faciculithus becomes rare toward the top; and this FAD is sometimes used to approximate Paleocene/Eocene boundary (Perch-Nielsen, 1985).
	 	57.49	dotted	DOTTED as alternate placement for base of NP8 also.  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 56.2 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) implying placement at Chron C25n.3 on that CK'95 scale (used here).  This is much higher than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995) of upper mid-Chron C25r.
	NP8	58.7		Paleocene nanno zone "NP8" has different definitions for the base.  H. riedelii FAD was former definition, and is used by Aubrey (in Berggren et al., 1995).  However, Perch-Nielsen (1985) considered this marker to be unreliable, so recommended usage of FAD of D. nobilis (which is also base of CP7).
	NP7	58.97		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 57.6 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at top of Chron C26n (C26n.95 used here) = same as observed at the Thanetian GSSP and same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a).
	NP6	59.54		At Zumaya GSSP, this event occurs within uppermost Chron C26r (C26r.9 is used here) = same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a) of ca. Chron C26r.85.  However, IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 58.0 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at top of Chron C26r.
	NP5	61.51		Cycle-strat of Selandian GSSP (summarized in Schmitz et al. (Episodes, in press as of 2011)) indicates that this event is about 0.1 myr above base-Selandian (used here).  This is about same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) of ca. Chron C26r.4.  In contrast, IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 59.9 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C29r.8.  Coeval with FAD Neochiastozygus perfectus (North Sea).
	NP4	63.25		Paleocene Nanno 'E. macellus' FAD assigned to lower C27r by Berggren et al. (1985b; 1995a) (C27r.25 is used here). Leg 145 places nearly 1.6 myr higher (at of Chron C26r), citing Backman (1986).  Berggren et al. (1995a) indicate that this is a solution-susceptible taxon; so the earlier FAD may be more appropriate.  Defines NP4 base.
	NP3	64.81		Paleocene Nanno Zone NP3 is subdivided into 4 subzones in North Sea by progressive FAD's of 'P. rosenkrantzii', N. modestus', and 'P. martinii' (Perch-Nielsen, 1985).
	NP2	65.47		This taxa might be C. intermedius (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June2011).  Defines NP2 base.  Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as lower Chron C29n (C29n.3).
	NP1	66.04		Paleocene basal Nanno Zone NP1 is a "gap" from the top of the Cretaceous to the FAD of C. tenuis (base of NP2).  Zone NP1 also defined by beginning of acme of Thoracosphaera (calc. dinoflagellate).   Zone NP1 has regional subzones.
	CC26	67.84		CC26 begins with FAD of either N. frequens or C. kamptneri (for proximal).  Within Chron 31n at low latitudes; but Austral-high-latitude is older (in mid-Chron C31r) at Maud Rise (see Huber et al'08, also as suggested on SEPM98 chart).  Huber et al'08 compute as 67.44 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics = C30n.14; which is close to the C30n.25 of Voight et al (submitted to EPSL) based on C13 correlations; therefore C30n.2 is used here.   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in B. argenta / junior Belemnite Zone (NW Europe), which is just slightly (0.2 myr) younger.   Burnett'98 states that N. frequens has a well-documented diachronous FO", which is youngest at northern high latitudes.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian; and a "younger" (high Boreal?) FAD as 5/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian.  Leg 207 assigned as 0.8 myr before end-Cretaceous => closer to Boreal placement on SEPM98.
	CC25	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	CC24	72.32	dashed	Upper part of C323n.2n (Huber et al'08 calibrate as 71.80 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics => C32n.2n.8).  Commonly used for base of CC24; although Leg 207 used the later LAD of T. orionatus.
	CC23	75.93		DASH -- Huber et al'08 value of about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements, and is used here.  EGI database calibrates as base of Upper Campanian (76.4 Ma in Tethyan; 76.3 Ma in Boreal).  However, in Boreal-realm studies, Jackie Lees (Burnett) assigns as upper Upper Campanian (ca. 74 Ma); and this offset is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL).  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD is middle of D. stevensoni Z.  Note: Husson et al. spells as "eximus" (not eximius; which is apparently a typo-error).
	CC22	76.82		Also known as Quadrum trifidum.  Huber et al'08 review and conclude C33n.55 (used here) is best calibration (76.29 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics; although their text says "C33n.65" -- we assumed their age model was correct, not text).  Bralower et al. (1995) suggest this is coeval with FAD of foraminifer G. calcarata (about 0.8 myr younger), which may indicate uncertainty in Campanian inter-correlations.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of Late Campanian (base D. nebrascense zone).  Slighly below base-Calcarata in Tanzania (Petrizzo et al'11).
	CC21	77.61		Also known as Quadrum sissingh.  Huber et al'08 cite Erba et al'95 as C33n.45; but their 77.10 Ma "relative to GTS04 magnetics" implies C33n.41 (used here).  Seems an arbitrary 1 myr below FAD of U. trifidum in Leg 171/207 tables.
	CC20	79		Just above base of C. plummera Foram Zone according to M. Petrizzo (June 2011 workshop notes) => assigned here as 0.2 myr above.  This FAD age-projection is very similar from estimate in ODP 171/207, which had coincided with mid-B. perplexus (late) zone.
	CC19	80.97		SEPM'98 had assigned LAD as base of Middle Camp (base B. obtusus)
	CC18	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.  Also called "Aspidolithus parcus parcus" in some schemes.   Base of preceeding B. parcus expansus is probably the "parca" one just above the boundary, and parca-parca occurs higher (J. Bergen 2005 pers. Commun.).
	CC17	84.08		Leg 207 places at essentially Late/Middle Santonian boundary (base of D. bassleri zone)
	CC16	86.38		Assigned here as ca. 85% up in Magadiceramus crenelatus inoceramid zone, based on Ten Mile Creek candidate for base-Santonian (although base of that zone is not established).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of P. serratomarginatus ammonite Zone.   In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 assigned FAD nearly 2 myr Higher -- just below top of C. saxitonianus-I. undulatoplicatus Zone in mid-Santonian !!   A lowermost-Santonian or uppermost-Coniacian (depending on future definition, and correlation to W.Interior ammonite usage) is supported by base-Santonian GSSP study, where L. cayeuxii is above base-D. asymetrica Foram Zone (the working definition of base-Santonian here; although age-calibration is uncertain), and just below the proposed macrofossil definition.  Estimates (SEPM, Leg 171/207) seem to converge on placement at Middle/Early Santonian boundary (base of C. vermiformis zone).   SEPM'98 had assigned Just above (0.1 myr) the LAD of S. septenarius; but order is opposite in Burnett's UC system.
	CC15	88.14	dashed	DASH:  Burnett'98 notes that "FO of Reinhardtites anthophorus is an unreliable datum.  Its inception, which is widely believed to be in the Coniacian, is somewhat obscure.  (etc).  Therefore, assigned here as mid-Zone UC10 (Burnett's placement of its discussion) with a Dash.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 1/10 up in C. saxitonianus -I. undulatoplicatus Z.   In contrast, Leg 171B assigns to base of Santonian (but, of course, pending definition).  
	CC14	89.77		Same as "Micula decussata".  Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone (used here).  FAD is Late/Middle Coniacian boundary in Leg 171 and Tethyan SEPM column; BUT placed at Middle/Early Coniacian in Boreal SEPM column.  
	CC13	90.24		SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of S. nigricollensis
	CC12	92.99	dashed	DASHED -- For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	CC11	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	CC10	96.16		FAD of L. acutus occurs near Thatcher Limestone in Western Interior (Andy Gale, UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011) => In Conlinoceras tarrantense (=Conlinoceras gilberti) ammonite zone.  Assigned here as middle of that Zone.  Base of CC10 has dual-markers (M. decoratus; L. acutus).  SEPM'98 has assigned both as Middle of A. granerosense zone (used here); but Leg 207 projects age as base of Middle Cenomanian (~1 myr below)
	CC9	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	CC8	112.95	dashed	DASH -- has taxonomy problems in the transitional trend to subcircular.  Base of this subcircular P. columnata is 30.75 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (12.45 myr) => 112.95 Ma = working definition for base of Albian.  (Primary control on Aptian-Albian interval!)    SEPM'98 has assigned as FAD as 2/10 up in L. tardefurcata Z., L. schrammeni s.z.; but coincides at Vohrum, Germany (used to set it)
	CC7	126.4		Also called Rucinolithus irregularis.   95% up in Chron M1n.   SEPM'98 had assigned as just below (0.1 myr) the base of Aptian.
	CC6	130.08		35% up in Chron M3r (merger of Bralower's and Bergen's placements).  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Chron M3r; but LAD was middle of H. caillaudianus Z. in France.
	CC5	132.54	dashed	DASH:  25% up in P. ligatus Zone.  SEPM'98 had also assigned LAD as 7/10 up in P. ligatus Z; but shifted down to avoid overlap with subzone b.
	CC4	134.98		Middle of H. trinodosum s.z. (of N. pachydicranus Zone).  With revised zonal scheme, this essentially is base of C. furcillata subzone.
	CC3	139.45		20% up in Chron M14r.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 7/10 up in T. otopeta Zone, which would shift to Berriasian, due to working-group change in boundary.
	CC2	144.93		Base of P. grandis subzone (J. Bergen's calibration).    SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. occitanica Z., D. dalmasi s.z.  Alternate name was C. angustiforatus.
	CC1	145.44		30% up in Chron M17r (Bralower), which would be AFTER base of CC1; but Bergen correlated to about 50% up in B. jacobi s.z. (used here).  However, Bergen's version might be N. steinmanii minor of Bralower.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as middle of B. jacobi Z., P. grandis s.z.
	NJT17b	145.52		FAD (from Casellato, 2011) is M19n.2n.7 (approx.)
	NJT17a	146.54		FAD (from Casellato, 2011) is base of M19r
	NJT16b	147.72		FAD (from Casellato, 2011) is base of M20n
	NJT16a	148.44		FAD (from Casellato, 2011) is base of M20 (put at base M20r).  Called "Microstaurus chiastius" in many publications, but NANNOTAX:  "The genus Microstaurus is regarded here as a junior synonym of Helenea".  In GTS04, the FAD are 50% up in Chron M20r.  On SEPM1998 chart, FADs are 40% up in M. ponti/B.peroni Z.
	NJT15b	149.8		FAD (from Casellato, 2011) is base of M21r.  In GTS04 was 10% up in Chron M21n.  On SEPM1998 chart, FADs are 45% up in S. admirandum/S. biruncinatum Zone.
	NJT15a	150.33		New zone of Casellato'10.  FAD is upper M22n (put as 65% here).  GTS04 = 20% up in Chron M22n
	NJT14	157.1		New zone of Casellato'10.  Bergen -- FAD is 90% up in E. bimammatum Zone.  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is base of T. hauffianum s.z. (upper E. bimammatum Z.one).
	NJT13b	160.84	dashed	DASH -- New zone of Casellato'10.  Base = "middle Oxfordian" (put here as base of P.plicatilis.  Not in SEPM chart.
	NJT13a	163.47		Top of new zone NJT12 of Casellato'10.  "Callov/Oxf boundary"; NJT13 is a "Gap zone
	NJT12	166.2		New zone of Casellato'2010.  Zone is total range of Cyclagelosphaera wiedmannii; from uppermost Bathonian (put 50% up in upper ammonite zone here) to Callov/Oxf boundary.  [Not on SEPM chart]
	NJT11	168.16	dashed	DASHED -- "Bathonian", begins in Zigzag; so put as 25% up. (and zone is quite long = most of NJ11 and NJ12a)
	NJT10b	169.28		Middle of S. subfurcatum (S. niortense) Zone.  J. Bergen's sections suggest a lower LAD at 25% up in this zone.  DTS1995 had this LAD at 50% up in G. baculata s.z. of S. niortense zone; but not in the SEPM chart.
	NJT10a	170.06		Begins in Laeviuschula zone (put 25% up here).  Not on SEPM.
	NJT9	170.4		Ellipsagelosphaera britannica (NANNOTAX:  "The generic concepts applied to these kinds (Watznaueria) of coccoliths have been rather inconsistently applied with different kinds of central area bars used as diagnostic characters (e.g., Ellipsagelosphaera for forms with transverse bars). Here we use Watznaueria in a broad sense. ...  Watznaueria britannica ... Often the dominant coccolith in Middle and Upper Jurassic assemblages, becoming rarer in the lower Cretaceous.") -- Mattoili-Erba say E. britannica of latest Aalenian is "good marker for boundary" (Aalen/Bajoc); and Jim Bergen has Base of Rare for E. britannica is 80% up in G. concavum Zone (about 0.1 myr below boundary -- which seems close enough).  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 30% up in the G. formosus s.z. of the G. concavum zone.
	NJT8c	171.15	dashed	DASH - Murchisonae zone (put 25% up) according to Mattioli-Erba.  NOTE:  C. margerelii continues to Paleocene according to Nannotax!!  GTS04 = 30% up in B. bradfordensis Zone (Aalenian, instead of in Toarcian on SEPM chart).  De Kaenel and Erba put this FAD much higher -- up to base of Bajocian!  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 20% up in walkeri s.z. H. (H.) discites zone.
	NJT8b	173.64		FAD of Lotharingius contractus is 25% up in L. opalinum Zone.  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 7/10 up in L. opalinum s.z. of L. opalinum zone.  Also called Watznaueria contracta (Lotharingius is a subset of the broader Watznaueria grouping; and applied to Early Jurassic forms).
	NJT8a	174.59		70% up in "D. levesque Zone" (combined P. dispansum-D. pseudoradiosa).  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 7/10 up in L. opalinum s.z. of L. opalinum zone.
	NJT7b	178.24		Set equal to Paul Bown's FAD.  Mattioli-Erba have as Variabils-Meneghini zones.  GTS04 = 95% up in H. serpentinum Zone.  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 50% up in lusitanicum s.z of the H. bifrons zone.  Formerly called "B. criotum" (genera change).
	NJT7a	180.49		Mattioli-Erba implied correlates with Boreal (set equal here); hence 90% up in H. faclciferum Zone.  Also called Biscutum striatum.   (Bown and Cooper, 2000).  SEPM chart had FAD at 8/10 up in H. falciferum s.z. (upper H. falciferum Zone).  Not used  (J. Bergen, pers. commun. to J.Ogg in Sept 2005).  DTS1995 had this FAD at base of sublevisoni s.z. of H. bifrons zone,  but not in the SEPM chart.
	NJT6	181.63		Correlative with Bown's NJ6.  Assigned as 5% up in H. serpentinum Zone (but disagreement in placement among workers).  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 45% up in H. pseudoserpentinum s.z of H. serpentinum zone. 
	NJ5b	182.7		Base D. tenuicostatum Zone (in Tethys).  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is base of D. (O.) tenuicostatum zone.
	NJT5a	185.53		60% up in A. margaritatus (= combined Tethyan portisi through acuratum subzones).  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 5% up in acuratum s.z. of algovianum zone.
	NJT4b	189.13		Event added by Mattoili-Erba'99 for their zonation.  Assumed same as Boreal (not on SEPM chart).
	NJT4a	190.09		middle of U. jamesoni Zone.  On SEPM1998 chart, FAD is 55% up in U. jamesoni s.z. U. jamesoni zone.
	NJT3b	193.06	dashed	DASHED -- "Sinemurian/Pliensbachian boundary interval" -- rather vague, so put as mid-Late Sinemurian.
	NJT3a	197.8		Base of A. semicostatum Zone (Bown and Cooper, 2000).  SEPM chart had FAD at 7/10 up in  charlesi s.z. (lower A. semicostatum Zone)
	NJT2b	199.3	dashed	DASHED -- mid-Sinemurian in Mattioli-Erba'99
	NJT2a	199.5	dashed	DASHED -- mid-Middle Hettangian in Mattioli-Erba'99; so probably same as Bown's placement = 75% up in S. angulata Zone (Bown and Cooper, 2000).
	NJT1	201.1		Base of Hettangian (old sense)
	NT2b	218.91	dashed	(nannolith, Incertae sedis)  DASHED -- FAD (and base of Eo. Zlambachensis subzone) is about mid-Norian (assigned here as middle of stage). 
	NT2a	222.89	dashed	(nannolith, Incertae sedis)  DASHED -- FAD recorded from Lower Norian, and is assigned here as mid-Lacian.  Zone NT2 (Prinsiosphaera triassica Zone) is its total range; with subzone NT2b "Orthopithonella geometrica subzone" in lower half.
	NT1	234.85		EARLIEST NANNOFOSSILS = Calcispheres, probably calcareous dinoflagellates, found in Southern Alps in Lower Carnian.   Orthopithonella misurinae and Obliquipithonella prasina (calcispheres), Carnicalyxia tabellata and Cassianospica curvata (nannoliths, Incertae sedis).  Appear same time as organic-walled dinocysts in geologic record.  Arbitrarily assigned as mid-Early Carnian.  Zone NT1 (Orthopithonella misurinae Zone) is FAD of Orth. misurinae to FAD of Prin. triassica.

Middle and Early CRETACEOUS = compiled by Jim Bergen, based on publications by Tim Bralower et al (1995),  J. Bergen (1994) and Eric de Kaenel
	TOP	5.59		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138); and reported at same time (5.58 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren. Kent, et al. (1995) assign as middle of Chron C3r (Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	d	5.94		Genus for amplificus was "Amaurolithus" in Berggren et al. (1995a) table; and had been used as base of "Subzone NN11d".  Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean.  This LAD (and LCO) is reported at same time (5.98 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  The LCO is at 6.12 Ma and 6.14 Ma in Pacific (ODP Legs 11 & 138) and in Mediterranean, respectively. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	c	6.91		Genus for amplificus was "Amaurolithus" in Berggren et al. (1995a) table; and had been used for a Subzone NN11c (and "CN9c") of their zonal scheme.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This FAD occurs later (6.68 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	7.42		LAD of Amaurolithus primus is also LAD of genus Amaurolithus.  Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean.  This FAD is recorded slightly later (7.36 Ma) in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	a	8.29		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]. Berggren et al. (1995) had this FAD as slightly older by 0.3 myr = lower C4r.
	TOP	42.87	dashed	DASH -- Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as middle of Chron C20n.5.  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 43.4 Ma based on Bachman (1986), but chron-age not given.  Base of NP16 was LAD of B. gladius, but rarely preserved (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June2011); therefore IODP Leg 320-321 used LAD of N. fulgens as proxy => NP15 becomes the Range Zone of N. fulgens.
	c	44.12		Poor calibration.  Berggren et al. (1995a) estimate as upper Chron C20r (C20r.7).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 44.0 Ma based on Bachman (1986), but chron-age not given.
	b	45.49		Composite Fig.7 of Agnini et al. (2006) indicates placement at Chron C20r.1 (used here).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 46.1 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing the same Agnini et al. (2006) but this is the base of Chron C20r on that CK'95 scale.
	a	46.29		Agnini et al. (2006) Fig. 7 suggests placement at Chron C21n.65.  This is 0.5 myr younger than chron-age of Berggren et al. (1995) =of lower-mid Chron C21n.
	b	47.84		FAD of B. inflatus = GSSP marker (Feb'11 ratification) = set as 39 precession cycles (used 20kyr cycles here) from base of Chron C21r in GSSP section (Molina et al., 2011) = middle of Chron C21r (prob. C21r.55), which is similar chron-age scaling in Berggren et al. (1995a).
	a	49.11		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 49.5 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2006) => Chron C21n.3 on that scale; used here.  This is just slightly younger than the chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of base of C22n.  The Lutetian GSSP nannofossils (Molina et al., Episodes, in press as of 2011) indicate the FAD may be as high as C21n.5.5.
	TOP	55.86		Paleocene Nannofossil Zone NP10 base (FAD of T. bramlettei) is a marker for the Paleocene/Eocene boundary; and is arbitary put 0.1 myr above boundary here.  "This [calibration problem] stems from the different opinions on Tribrachiatus bramlettei, als known by some (also PEAT author(s)) as Rhomboaster bramlettei. This has been a controversy for over 20 years, without a good solution, I think.  I'm told the confusion may also have partly arisen from the various uses of first common occurrence, first rare occurrence, first consistent occurrence, etc.  In this case I would accommodate at least to some extent for the GSSP data of Dababiya (Aubry et al. 2007) where there is quite a portion of NP9b above the base of the Eocene, corresponding to E1 and part of E2. Perhaps put base NP10 just slightly above base Eocene and not below this."  [Paul Bown to J.Ogg; June'11].
	b	56.66		Base of Paleocene Nanno Zone CP8b concides with EITHER FAD of Romboaster spp, or FAD of C. eodela (either FAD of rare; or FAD of Common as used by Agnini et al'07).  Within Zone NP9 several species of Rhomboaster evolve, and can be used for a fine subdivision (see Perch-Nielsen, 1985).
	a	57.21		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 56.0 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C25n.8 (chron placement used here).  This is slightly higher than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of about Chron C25n.4.
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	b	67.3		CC26b (or NC20d) begins with FAD of M. prinsii = Lower Chron 29r -- Huber et al'08 say "average mean" of 66.79 relative to GTS04 (= C30n.5, used here), although they had a misleading 65.79 "average mean" in their comment, which Brian Huber corrected for J.Ogg (June'11).  Leg 207 assigned as 0.4 myr before end-Cretaceous.  Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes); with Boreal FAD later than Tethyan (Von Salis, 1998, SEPM chart).  Assigned previously (1998) as simply 1 myr prior to end of Cretaceous (ODP Leg 171B assignment, and average of Tethyan/Boreal of von Salis).
	a	67.84		CC26 begins with FAD of either N. frequens or C. kamptneri (for proximal).  Within Chron 31n at low latitudes; but Austral-high-latitude is older (in mid-Chron C31r) at Maud Rise (see Huber et al'08, also as suggested on SEPM98 chart).  Huber et al'08 compute as 67.44 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics = C30n.14; which is close to the C30n.25 of Voight et al (submitted to EPSL) based on C13 correlations; therefore C30n.2 is used here.   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in B. argenta / junior Belemnite Zone (NW Europe), which is just slightly (0.2 myr) younger.   Burnett'98 states that N. frequens has a well-documented diachronous FO", which is youngest at northern high latitudes.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian; and a "younger" (high Boreal?) FAD as 5/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian.  Leg 207 assigned as 0.8 myr before end-Cretaceous => closer to Boreal placement on SEPM98.
	c	69	dashed	FAD of M. murus (base of Zone CC25c of Self-Trail'01) assigned by Huber et al'08 as 68.45 Ma (corrected) relative to GTS04 magnetics (upper Chron C31n) = C31n.3  DASH (partly from inconsistencies in their text):  Leg 207 assigned as 1.2 myr before end-Cretaceous (arbitrary equal-spacing of FADs of M. murus, N. frequens, and M. prinsii); but SEPM98 placement used in GTS04 was base Chron C31n).  DASHED -- Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes). 
	b	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 suggests that there is diachroneity.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	a	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	TOP	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	b	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors -- "rare but cute" (D.Watkins).  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo -- used here (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide; and this was the basis for assigning in Leg 171 (but Ogg's Leg 171 table was slightly lower).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense).  J. Bergen puts also at base of Turonian), but below LAD of R. asper.
	a	96.16		FAD of L. acutus occurs near Thatcher Limestone in Western Interior (Andy Gale, UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011) => In Conlinoceras tarrantense (=Conlinoceras gilberti) ammonite zone.  Assigned here as middle of that Zone.  Base of CC10 has dual-markers (M. decoratus; L. acutus).  SEPM'98 has assigned both as Middle of A. granerosense zone (used here); but Leg 207 projects age as base of Middle Cenomanian (~1 myr below)
	b	100.84		Bown shows as 30% up in S. dispar Ammonite Zone (now interval from base M.rostratum to top M.perinflatum Zones), but found higher [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI], therefore assigned here as 60% up.  Could be higher (40% up in R. appenninica Foram Zone was in TSC-tropical of 2010).  SEPM'98 assigned as Middle of M. perinflatum subzone.
	a	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	b	110.73		Nomenclature is "phacelosus" in older literature, but others seem to be using "orionatus" now (e.g., Bralower, Burnett).  Bralower-Leckie charts places this FAD in middle of T. primula Foram Zone, but this would be inconsistent with cycle-scaling of overlying FAD of A. albianus (base of next higher NC zone), therefore placed at 25% up in this table.  SEPM'98 had assigned Tranolithus "phacelosus" FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z., or at same level as FAD of Axopodo. albianus.
	a	112.95	dashed	DASH -- has taxonomy problems in the transitional trend to subcircular.  Base of this subcircular P. columnata is 30.75 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (12.45 myr) => 112.95 Ma = working definition for base of Albian.  (Primary control on Aptian-Albian interval!)    SEPM'98 has assigned as FAD as 2/10 up in L. tardefurcata Z., L. schrammeni s.z.; but coincides at Vohrum, Germany (used to set it)
	b	126.18		40% up in D. tuarkyricus (D. oglanlensis) Zone.   [NOTE: New scaling for E. Aptian makes the interval between FADs of R. angustus and E. floralis as 2 myr, instead of only 1 myr.]  
	a	126.4		Also called Rucinolithus irregularis.   95% up in Chron M1n.   SEPM'98 had assigned as just below (0.1 myr) the base of Aptian.
	TOP	130.08		35% up in Chron M3r (merger of Bralower's and Bergen's placements).  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Chron M3r; but LAD was middle of H. caillaudianus Z. in France.
	b	131.51	dashed	DASH:  Middle (75%) of Chron M5r [Bralower].  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD as 6/10 up in P. angulicostata auct. Z.
	a	132.54	dashed	DASH:  25% up in P. ligatus Zone.  SEPM'98 had also assigned LAD as 7/10 up in P. ligatus Z; but shifted down to avoid overlap with subzone b.
	b	133.53		25% up in C. loryi Zone.  Bralower uses this to subdivide NC4, but it seems that base of NC4 (LAD of T. verenae) is ABOVE this L. bollii FAD.  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD as 2/10 up in C. loryi Z.
	a	134.98		Middle of H. trinodosum s.z. (of N. pachydicranus Zone).  With revised zonal scheme, this essentially is base of C. furcillata subzone.
	b	137.55		10% up in B. campylotoxus Zone.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. pertransiens Zone.  Note:  "SEPM98" age is different than actual SEPM chart, due to change in extent of T. pertransiens.
	a	139.45		20% up in Chron M14r.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 7/10 up in T. otopeta Zone, which would shift to Berriasian, due to working-group change in boundary.

	CN15	0.29		Ubiquitous species, often forming blooms. Coccospheres often with multiple layers of coccoliths.  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 & 138) and Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  Age is recorded slightly younger (0.27 myr) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) placed similarly= O-18 stage 8; Chron C1n.67. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN14	1.04		Pleistocene Nanno Zone CN14a begins with FAD of Gephyrocapsa oceanica.  But this event is not tabulated by Berggren or Leg 145.  Figure 4 in Berggren et al. (1995) draws the base of CN14a at approximately 1.0 Ma, and Lourens et al (GTS2004) assign it at re-entrance of medium Gephyrocapsa
	CN13	1.93		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD of D. brouweri is recorded slightly earlier (1.95 Ma) in Mediterranean (refs. 11, 22-25), and significantly earlier (2.06 Ma) in Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Berggren et al. (1995b) assign in lowermost Olduvai; 1.95 Ma; therefore at base of Chron C2n. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN12	3.7		This LAD defines top of NN15, therefore at base of NN16.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (3.79 Ma and 3.84 Ma) in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138) and in eastern Mediterranean, respectively.  Acccording to Berggren et al. (1995b), Pliocene nannofossil Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus (LAD) occurs in Mediterranean at about Chron C2Ar.7 (uppermost part of upper-reversed interval of Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN11	4.5		Lourens et al (2004) referred to this FAD as a "subbottom".  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138).  In Berggren et al. (1995b), the Pliocene nannofossil Amaurolithus primus (LAD) occurs in Nunivak subchron (ca. 4.55 Ma) in Mediterranean; or near top of Sidufjall subchron (ca. 4.58 Ma) in oceanic areas; therefore at about Chron C3n.3n.8. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN10	5.59		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138); and reported at same time (5.58 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren. Kent, et al. (1995) assign as middle of Chron C3r (Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN9	8.29		Miocene Nannofossil Zone NN11 begins with either the FAD of D. berggreni (an earlier event) or of D. quinqueramus; the definition problem arises depending if these two taxa are considered to be the same species.  Bukry (1981) defined Zone CN8b beginning with FAD of D. neorectus and/or FAD of D. loeblichii, and ending with FAD of D. surculus; but these events are not calibrated in the scales of Berggren (in prep, SEPM) or Leg 145.  Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995) indicates that FAD of D. berggrenii defines base of both NN11 and CN9; and this placement is shown in this chart.
	CN8	9.53		Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean.  LAD occurs slightly earlier (9.69 Ma) at Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Astronomical age implies approximately Chron C4Ar.2r.5. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Correlations, as indicated by Berggren et al. (1995) were inconsistent; with younger LADs being reported elsewhere in previous literature -- C4Ar.2r.5; 9.4 Ma; or C4A; 8.67 Ma or 9.37 Ma; therefore C4Ar.2r.5 seems best estimate (nearly same as astronomical tuning).
	CN7	10.55		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  FAD occurs much younger (10.18 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.   [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Berggren et al. (1995a) note that this datum is "controversial" and inconsistent, with different reported correlations to magnetostratigraphy.  More checks on this calibration are needed.
	CN6	10.89		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  FAD occurs slightly later (10.73 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Very poorly constrained age, and Atlantic may be 0.4 m.y. before Pacific -- Berggren et al. (1995) give C5r.2r (Atl.); 11.3 Ma or 11.1 Ma; therefore an older placement (by 0.4 myr) of C5r.2r.5 was used on previous versions of this chart.
	CN5	13.53		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926); but LAD is reported slightly earlier (13.654 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  The offset, although only 100 kyr, causes a problem, because this nannofossil S. heteromorphus LAD had been a candidate for the "primary marker" for base-Serravallian GSSP as placed in the in the Mediterranean region.  Berggren et al. (1995a) had a similar chron-age assignment of approximately Chron C5ABr.6. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	CN4	14.91		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]   Berggren et al. (1995a) had placed this LAD about 0.6 myr older as middle of Chron C5Br.
	CN3	17.95		Lourens et al (2004) assign this event as a LCO that is astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]   This is only slightly above the LAD, which was the original definition of the zone (a 0.1 myr difference according to J. Bergen, pers. commun., 2005).
	CN2	19.03		Berggren et al (1995) had shown FAD of S. belemnos as defining base of CN2.  But Lourens et al (2004) assign base-CN2 as equivalent to base NN3.  Actually, Young et al'98 consider S. belemnos to be the better marker.
	CN1	23.13		Chron C6Cn.2r.5.  Leg 145 referred to this LAD as "top of acme"; but ODP Leg 171 scheme assigned as LAD.  Global (not just high-latitude) marker for base of NN1.  "Reticulofenestra bisecta" was called "Dictyococcites bisectus" in Perch-Nielsen (1985).  The LAD of 'R. bisectus' is used to approximate the NP25/NN1 boundary in high latitudes; and was "substituted for H. recta, the marker of the NP15/NN1 boundary in Martini's (1971) zonal scheme" by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995). [ODP Leg 145 Shipboard Scientific Party (1993)]
	CP19	29.62	dashed	DASH -- Difficult to pin down age within the transition; therefore has a wide range fo calibrations.    Cycle-calibrated as 27.14 Ma (4.11 myr relative to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al.'09 (Eq. Pac.); but Paul Bown (to J.Ogg, June'11) advised to not use this very high placement, because this might be a very high level in the transition.  Nanno 'Sphenolithus ciperoensis FAD' is assigned by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995) within Subchron C11n.2n; but was placed at essentially base of Chron C11n.2n at proposed Chattian GSSP (Coccioni et al., GSA Bull., 2008).  However, to avoid overlap with cycle-scaled "underlying" CP18 marker, the base of this NP24/CP19 is set slightly higher at Chron C11n.2n.8.  This is about 1.3 myr older than estimate in Leg 145 table. [Berggren et al. (1995a); Coccioni et al. (2008); P. Bown (pers. comm., 2011)]
	CP18	30	dashed	DASH:  Diachronous -- Oligocene Nanno 'Sphenolithus distentus FAD' is "a very inconsistent datum which may occur as low as Nanno Zone NP21 ... or as high as in Zone NP23" (Aubry, in Berggren et al., 1995).  Cycle-scaled placement by Blaj et al. (2009; Eq. Pac.) is 30.00 Ma (6.97 myr relative to base-Miocene of 23.03 Ma; used here).  Age estimates in Aubry's table range from 31.5 to 33.1 Ma (but the oldest level was "probably due to another species, newly called as "Sp. akropodus", being confused for it"; Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June'11).  THe oldest FAD would imply that zone "CP18" begins before "CP17"! [Blaj et al. (2009)]
	CP17	32.02	dashed	Diachronous -- Oligocene Nanno 'Reticulofenestra umbilicus LAD' was specified as ">14 micron" in Leg 145 table.  This LAD occurs earlier (32.3 Ma) in low-mid latitudes than in southern high-latitudes (31.3 Ma) = 1m.y. diachroneity.  For simplicity, I have placed the associated Zone NP23; CP17 base with the mid-latitude level (32.3 Ma).
	CP16	34.44	dashed	Diachronous.  Cycle-calibrated as 34.44 Ma (11.41 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is consistent with the chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) as revised by Leg 145 = middle of Chron C13r.
	CP15	37.98		Eocene Nanno zone CP15 is not divided into subzones in Fig. 18 of Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), but the FAD of I. recurvus (= base of NP19-20) is used in some schemes for defining a "CP15b" subzone. 
	CP14	41.94	dashed	DASH -- Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as middle of Chron C19r (C19r.4).  Base of zone CP14 is FAD of R. umbilicus, but a further criteria of >10 ﾵm is used for clarity rather than the pure FAD (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June 2011).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 42.5 Ma for >14 ﾵm based on Bachman (1987), but chron-age is not given.  Eocene Nanno 'R. umbilica' FAD is latitude dependent; and occurs as early as basal C20r in Contessa section (Italy). [Berggren et al. (1995a); IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010)]
	CP13	46.29		Agnini et al. (2006) Fig. 7 suggests placement at Chron C21n.65.  This is 0.5 myr younger than chron-age of Berggren et al. (1995) =of lower-mid Chron C21n.
	CP12	49.11		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 49.5 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2006) => Chron C21n.3 on that scale; used here.  This is just slightly younger than the chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of base of C22n.  The Lutetian GSSP nannofossils (Molina et al., Episodes, in press as of 2011) indicate the FAD may be as high as C21n.5.5.
	CP11	50.5	dashed	DASH (CP11 only) -- Eocene Nanno Zone CP11 base is FAD of Toweius? crassus; and this event is often used to approximate base of NP13 (see discussion in Perch-Nielsen, 1985).  Following Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), NP13 and CP11 bases are made coeval, but there is no direct CP11 calibration.
	CP10	53.7		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 53.1 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C24n.3n.5 (used here).  This is about 0.25 older than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of the middle of Chron C24n.2r.
	CP9	54.95		Agnini et al. (2007) assigned as Chron C24r.69 (used here); which is nearly same as relative chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995) of ca. Chron C24r.75.
	CP8	57.21		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 56.0 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C25n.8 (chron placement used here).  This is slightly higher than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of about Chron C25n.4.
	CP7	57.49		DOTTED as alternate placement for base of NP8 also.  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 56.2 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) implying placement at Chron C25n.3 on that CK'95 scale (used here).  This is much higher than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995) of upper mid-Chron C25r.
	CP6	58.97		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 57.6 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at top of Chron C26n (C26n.95 used here) = same as observed at the Thanetian GSSP and same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a).
	CP5	59.54		At Zumaya GSSP, this event occurs within uppermost Chron C26r (C26r.9 is used here) = same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a) of ca. Chron C26r.85.  However, IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 58.0 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at top of Chron C26r.
	CP4	61.51		Cycle-strat of Selandian GSSP (summarized in Schmitz et al. (Episodes, in press as of 2011)) indicates that this event is about 0.1 myr above base-Selandian (used here).  This is about same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) of ca. Chron C26r.4.  In contrast, IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 59.9 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C29r.8.  Coeval with FAD Neochiastozygus perfectus (North Sea).
	CP3	63.25		Paleocene Nanno 'E. macellus' FAD assigned to lower C27r by Berggren et al. (1985b; 1995a) (C27r.25 is used here). Leg 145 places nearly 1.6 myr higher (at of Chron C26r), citing Backman (1986).  Berggren et al. (1995a) indicate that this is a solution-susceptible taxon; so the earlier FAD may be more appropriate.  Defines NP4 base.
	CP2	64.81		Middle of Chron C28r. [Berggren et al. (1995a)]
	CP1	66.04		Base of Cenozoic  (Chron C29r.5).  Zone NP1 begins with the acme of Thoracosphaera (calc. dinoflagellate), or is the interval from the top of the Cretaceous to the FAD of C. tenuis (base of NP2).
	NC23	69	dashed	FAD of M. murus (base of Zone CC25c of Self-Trail'01) assigned by Huber et al'08 as 68.45 Ma (corrected) relative to GTS04 magnetics (upper Chron C31n) = C31n.3  DASH (partly from inconsistencies in their text):  Leg 207 assigned as 1.2 myr before end-Cretaceous (arbitrary equal-spacing of FADs of M. murus, N. frequens, and M. prinsii); but SEPM98 placement used in GTS04 was base Chron C31n).  DASHED -- Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes). 
	NC22	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 suggests that there is diachroneity.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	NC21	71.31		Also known as Quadrum trifidum (and T. trifidus).  Calibrated from uppermost Belem. obtusa (90% up in that Zone is used here) via Sr 87/86 to US Western Interior ages (lower B. grandis).  Occurs ~0.75 myr above Tercis GSSP of base-Maastrichtian (used here; and by Huber et al'08 but they cited "Ogg, 2007" which is circular).
	NC20	76.82		Also known as Quadrum trifidum.  Huber et al'08 review and conclude C33n.55 (used here) is best calibration (76.29 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics; although their text says "C33n.65" -- we assumed their age model was correct, not text).  Bralower et al. (1995) suggest this is coeval with FAD of foraminifer G. calcarata (about 0.8 myr younger), which may indicate uncertainty in Campanian inter-correlations.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of Late Campanian (base D. nebrascense zone).  Slighly below base-Calcarata in Tanzania (Petrizzo et al'11).
	NC19	79		Just above base of C. plummera Foram Zone according to M. Petrizzo (June 2011 workshop notes) => assigned here as 0.2 myr above.  This FAD age-projection is very similar from estimate in ODP 171/207, which had coincided with mid-B. perplexus (late) zone.
	NC18	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.  Also called "Aspidolithus parcus parcus" in some schemes.   Base of preceeding B. parcus expansus is probably the "parca" one just above the boundary, and parca-parca occurs higher (J. Bergen 2005 pers. Commun.).
	NC17	86.38		Assigned here as ca. 85% up in Magadiceramus crenelatus inoceramid zone, based on Ten Mile Creek candidate for base-Santonian (although base of that zone is not established).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of P. serratomarginatus ammonite Zone.   In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 assigned FAD nearly 2 myr Higher -- just below top of C. saxitonianus-I. undulatoplicatus Zone in mid-Santonian !!   A lowermost-Santonian or uppermost-Coniacian (depending on future definition, and correlation to W.Interior ammonite usage) is supported by base-Santonian GSSP study, where L. cayeuxii is above base-D. asymetrica Foram Zone (the working definition of base-Santonian here; although age-calibration is uncertain), and just below the proposed macrofossil definition.  Estimates (SEPM, Leg 171/207) seem to converge on placement at Middle/Early Santonian boundary (base of C. vermiformis zone).   SEPM'98 had assigned Just above (0.1 myr) the LAD of S. septenarius; but order is opposite in Burnett's UC system.
	NC16	89.77		Same as "Micula decussata".  Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone (used here).  FAD is Late/Middle Coniacian boundary in Leg 171 and Tethyan SEPM column; BUT placed at Middle/Early Coniacian in Boreal SEPM column.  
	NC15	90.24		SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of S. nigricollensis
	NC14	92.99	dashed	DASH:  Burnett'98 "FO of consistently-occurring K. magnificus lies areound the FO of E. eximius." (used here)  Not in Leg 207 table or SEPM chart; but highlighted by Bralower-Leckie as base of NC14 with assigned age of 91.8 Ma (using Gradstein et al., 1994 scale), which projects as 5% up in C. woollgari Zone.  However, FAD ranges as low as lower-Lower Turonian and as high as lower-Middle Turonian (Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI]
	NC12 - 13	94.3	dotted	DOTTED -- Burnett'98 assigns LAD of P. asper as base of B. clydense Zone (used here).  LAD of P. asper (R. asper) is used by Bralower et al (1995) to define base of NC13, and LAD of A. albianus for base of NC12, with 1 myr separation.  Burnett'98 assigns as base of B. clydense Zone (used here).  This provides a tie to Tethyan zonations; although J. Bergen assigned this LAD in lower Turonian (above LAD of M. chiastius).  Leg 171B has a cluster of LADs (C. kennedyi, R. asper, A. albianus) at ~0.4 myr below top of Cenomanian (ammonite zone?); but separated here, even though they occur quite close together.
	NC11	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	NC10	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	NC9	109.94		Base of nannofossil A. albianus (called "P." albianus in Grippo et al., 2004) is 23.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (9.5 myr) => 109.1 Ma.  This projects to base of P. steinmanni ammonite subzone, rather than to 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z. of SEPM98 column.
	NC8	112.95	dashed	DASH -- has taxonomy problems in the transitional trend to subcircular.  Base of this subcircular P. columnata is 30.75 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (12.45 myr) => 112.95 Ma = working definition for base of Albian.  (Primary control on Aptian-Albian interval!)    SEPM'98 has assigned as FAD as 2/10 up in L. tardefurcata Z., L. schrammeni s.z.; but coincides at Vohrum, Germany (used to set it)
	NC7	123.88		Base E. floralis (base NC7A) is about 2/3rds up in L.cabri foram zone (in broad sense) = "Nannoconid Return event" (Erba, 2004, Marine Micro).  GTS04 = 121.9 Ma (2.1 myr above base-Aptian) (was 119.0 Ma in Leckie's chart), which sets base of D. furcata Zone.  Time-control point for scaling E. Aptian.  SEPM'98 had FAD projected to 8/10 up in D. forbesi Zone (= D. weisi)  on SEPM chart; but now projects much higher (base of D. furcata Zone)
	NC6	126.4		Also called Rucinolithus irregularis.   95% up in Chron M1n.   SEPM'98 had assigned as just below (0.1 myr) the base of Aptian.
	NC5	132.87	dashed	DASH:  55% up in S. sayni Zone.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Middle of S.sayni Z.
	NC4	132.93	dashed	DASH approximation in mid-Hauterivian (arbitrarily put at 40% of S. sayni Zone here to avoid overlap with NC5).  Defines base of NC4, but difficult to pinpoint LAD.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Middle of H. trinodosum s.z. (of N. pachydicranus Zone).  With revised zonal scheme, this essentially is base of C. furcillata subzone.
	NC3	139.45		20% up in Chron M14r.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 7/10 up in T. otopeta Zone, which would shift to Berriasian, due to working-group change in boundary.
	NC2	144.93		Base of P. grandis subzone (J. Bergen's calibration).    SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. occitanica Z., D. dalmasi s.z.  Alternate name was C. angustiforatus.
	NC1	145.44		30% up in Chron M17r (Bralower), which would be AFTER base of CC1; but Bergen correlated to about 50% up in B. jacobi s.z. (used here).  However, Bergen's version might be N. steinmanii minor of Bralower.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as middle of B. jacobi Z., P. grandis s.z.

	TOP	0.29		Ubiquitous species, often forming blooms. Coccospheres often with multiple layers of coccoliths.  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 & 138) and Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  Age is recorded slightly younger (0.27 myr) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) placed similarly= O-18 stage 8; Chron C1n.67. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	0.44		LAD defines top of NN19, therefore at base of NN20.  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 & 138) and Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  Age is recorded slightly older (0.47 myr) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) placed similaly = O-18 stage 12; Chron C1n.4. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	a	1.04		Pleistocene Nanno Zone CN14a begins with FAD of Gephyrocapsa oceanica.  But this event is not tabulated by Berggren or Leg 145.  Figure 4 in Berggren et al. (1995) draws the base of CN14a at approximately 1.0 Ma, and Lourens et al (GTS2004) assign it at re-entrance of medium Gephyrocapsa
	b	1.73		Pleistocene Nanno Zone CN13b begins with FAD of Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica; but this event is not tabulated by Berggren et al. or Leg 145.  Diagram in Berggren et al. implies that the age is about 1.7 Ma.
	a	1.93		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD of D. brouweri is recorded slightly earlier (1.95 Ma) in Mediterranean (refs. 11, 22-25), and significantly earlier (2.06 Ma) in Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Berggren et al. (1995b) assign in lowermost Olduvai; 1.95 Ma; therefore at base of Chron C2n. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	d	2.39		LAD of D. pentaradiatus (quintatus) defines top of NN17, therefore at base of NN18.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded earlier (2.51 Ma) in Mediterranean.  Berggren et al. (1995b) places near Matuyama/Gauss boundary, or at about Chron C2r.3r.25.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	c	2.49		LAD of D. surculus defines top of NN16, therefore at base of NN17.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (2.52 Ma and 2.54 Ma) in Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 and in eastern Mediterranean, respectively.  Berggren et al. (1995b) place near Matuyama/Gauss boundary at about Chron C2r.3r.1.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	2.8		Lourens et al (GTS2004 table) refers to this LAD as a "subtop".  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926) and eastern Mediterranean.  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (2.87 Ma) in Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138.  Pliocene nannofossil 'Discoaster tarnalis' (LAD) occurs at 2.73 Ma in Mediterranean in Berggren et al. (1995b) compilation, with main assignment at about Chron C2An.1n.6 (near top of Gauss).  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	a	3.7		This LAD defines top of NN15, therefore at base of NN16.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This LAD is recorded slightly earlier (3.79 Ma and 3.84 Ma) in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138) and in eastern Mediterranean, respectively.  Acccording to Berggren et al. (1995b), Pliocene nannofossil Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus (LAD) occurs in Mediterranean at about Chron C2Ar.7 (uppermost part of upper-reversed interval of Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	4.13		Lourens et al. (2004) referred to this FCO as a "subbottom".  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138) and in eastern Mediterranean (as 4.12 Ma).  In Berggren et al. (1995b) compilation, Pliocene nannofossil 'Discoaster asymmetricus' (FCO) occurs at about Chron C2n.1n.8 (near top of Cochiti, or in upper Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	a	4.5		Lourens et al (2004) referred to this FAD as a "subbottom".  Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138).  In Berggren et al. (1995b), the Pliocene nannofossil Amaurolithus primus (LAD) occurs in Nunivak subchron (ca. 4.55 Ma) in Mediterranean; or near top of Sidufjall subchron (ca. 4.58 Ma) in oceanic areas; therefore at about Chron C3n.3n.8. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	c	5.12		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138). This FAD is reported later (5.05 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  In Berggren et al. (1995b), this datum is diachronous among regions -- Pliocene nannofossil Cerotolithus rugosus (FAD) occurs near top of Nunivak (4.5 Ma) in Mediterranean, but within Thvera (about Chron C3n.4n.5); 5.0-5.23 Ma in oceanic areas. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	5.35		Pliocene Nannofossil Zone CP10b begins with FAD of C. acutus AND/OR the LAD of genus Triquetrorhabdulus.
	a	5.59		Astronomically tuned in Pacific (ODP Legs 111 and 138); and reported at same time (5.58 Ma) in Atlantic Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926.  Berggren. Kent, et al. (1995) assign as middle of Chron C3r (Gilbert). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	d	5.94		Miocene Nanno zone "NN11d" and "CN 9d" are taken from chart of Aubry (in Berggren et al., SEPM, 1995).  Similar chart in Berggren et al. (GSA, 1995) has slightly different ages, but does not specify the nannofossil definitions.
	c	6.91		Genus for amplificus was "Amaurolithus" in Berggren et al. (1995a) table; and had been used for a Subzone NN11c (and "CN9c") of their zonal scheme.  Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  This FAD occurs later (6.68 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	b	7.42		LAD of Amaurolithus primus is also LAD of genus Amaurolithus.  Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean.  This FAD is recorded slightly later (7.36 Ma) in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	a	8.29		Miocene Nannofossil Zone NN11 begins with either the FAD of D. berggreni (an earlier event) or of D. quinqueramus; the definition problem arises depending if these two taxa are considered to be the same species.  Bukry (1981) defined Zone CN8b beginning with FAD of D. neorectus and/or FAD of D. loeblichii, and ending with FAD of D. surculus; but these events are not calibrated in the scales of Berggren (in prep, SEPM) or Leg 145.  Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995) indicates that FAD of D. berggrenii defines base of both NN11 and CN9; and this placement is shown in this chart.
	TOP	10.89		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926).  FAD occurs slightly later (10.73 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  Very poorly constrained age, and Atlantic may be 0.4 m.y. before Pacific -- Berggren et al. (1995) give C5r.2r (Atl.); 11.3 Ma or 11.1 Ma; therefore an older placement (by 0.4 myr) of C5r.2r.5 was used on previous versions of this chart.
	b	11.9		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926); and simultaneous (11.90 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)].  This "FCO" of Lourens et al. (2004) seems to correspond in calibration to the "FAD" of Berggren et al. (1995a), which they summarized as approximately lower Chron C5r.3r.
	a	13.53		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926); but LAD is reported slightly earlier (13.654 Ma) in eastern Mediterranean.  The offset, although only 100 kyr, causes a problem, because this nannofossil S. heteromorphus LAD had been a candidate for the "primary marker" for base-Serravallian GSSP as placed in the in the Mediterranean region.  Berggren et al. (1995a) had a similar chron-age assignment of approximately Chron C5ABr.6. [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]
	TOP	19.03		Astronomically tuned in Atlantic (Leg 154, Sites 925 & 926). [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]   Berggren et al. (1995a) had similar assignment that projected as Chron C6n.9 in their magnetostratigraphic scale.
	c	22.82		B Discoaster druggi (sensu stricto) -- Astronomically tuned in eastern Mediterranean (based on projecting astronomical tuning of long-period minima to base-Miocene), which is consistent with ODP Leg 154.  [Lourens et al. (2004; Table A2.2)]  However, smaller forms appear earlier, at end of Oligocene (J. Bergen and E. de Kaenel, pers. commun., 2005).  FAD has been assigned to C6Cn in Leg 145 compilation, but Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995) assigns 0.5 m.y. higher (in C6Br); so earlier chart had used C6Br.5.
	a/b	23.13		Chron C6Cn.2r.5.  Leg 145 referred to this LAD as "top of acme"; but ODP Leg 171 scheme assigned as LAD.  Global (not just high-latitude) marker for base of NN1.  "Reticulofenestra bisecta" was called "Dictyococcites bisectus" in Perch-Nielsen (1985).  The LAD of 'R. bisectus' is used to approximate the NP25/NN1 boundary in high latitudes; and was "substituted for H. recta, the marker of the NP15/NN1 boundary in Martini's (1971) zonal scheme" by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995). [ODP Leg 145 Shipboard Scientific Party (1993)]
	b	26.84		Oligocene Nanno 'Sphenolithus distentus' LAD  is cycle-calibrated as 26.81 Ma (3.78 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is younger than chron-age of C9n by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995) at 27.5 Ma, but is consistent with mid-Chron C8n.2n correlation in Leg 145 table.  The LCO was placed in Chron 9n in basal-Chattian compilation of Italian sections by Coccioni et al. (GSA Bull, 2008).
	a	29.62		DASH -- Difficult to pin down age within the transition; therefore has a wide range fo calibrations.    Cycle-calibrated as 27.14 Ma (4.11 myr relative to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al.'09 (Eq. Pac.); but Paul Bown (to J.Ogg, June'11) advised to not use this very high placement, because this might be a very high level in the transition.  Nanno 'Sphenolithus ciperoensis FAD' is assigned by Aubry (in Berggren, Kent, et al., 1995) within Subchron C11n.2n; but was placed at essentially base of Chron C11n.2n at proposed Chattian GSSP (Coccioni et al., GSA Bull., 2008).  However, to avoid overlap with cycle-scaled "underlying" CP18 marker, the base of this NP24/CP19 is set slightly higher at Chron C11n.2n.8.  This is about 1.3 myr older than estimate in Leg 145 table. [Berggren et al. (1995a); Coccioni et al. (2008); P. Bown (pers. comm., 2011)]
	TOP	32.02	dashed	Diachronous -- Oligocene Nanno 'Reticulofenestra umbilicus LAD' was specified as ">14 micron" in Leg 145 table.  This LAD occurs earlier (32.3 Ma) in low-mid latitudes than in southern high-latitudes (31.3 Ma) = 1m.y. diachroneity.  For simplicity, I have placed the associated Zone NP23; CP17 base with the mid-latitude level (32.3 Ma).
	c	32.92		Also known as "Ericsonia formosa".  Diachronous (Berggren et al. (1995a) indicate the LAD is 7 myr nearly earlier in south high lat!).  Cycle-calibrated as 32.92 Ma (9.89 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is same as chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) as revised by Leg 145 = lowermost Chron C12r.
	b	33.43		Zone CP16b begins shortly (0.4 myr) after Eocene/Oligocene boundary.
	a	34.44	dashed	Diachronous.  Cycle-calibrated as 34.44 Ma (11.41 myr prior to 23.03 Ma for base-Miocene) by Blaj et al. (2009) (Eq. Pac.).  This is consistent with the chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) as revised by Leg 145 = middle of Chron C13r.
	TOP	37.98		Eocene Nanno zone CP15 is not divided into subzones in Fig. 18 of Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), but the FAD of I. recurvus (= base of NP19-20) is used in some schemes for defining a "CP15b" subzone. 
	b	40.4		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995) = upper Chron C18r (C18r.75).  LAD reported higher (C18n) in Hole 748 (ref. m).
	a	41.94	dashed	DASH -- Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as middle of Chron C19r (C19r.4).  Base of zone CP14 is FAD of R. umbilicus, but a further criteria of >10 ﾵm is used for clarity rather than the pure FAD (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June 2011).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 42.5 Ma for >14 ﾵm based on Bachman (1987), but chron-age is not given.  Eocene Nanno 'R. umbilica' FAD is latitude dependent; and occurs as early as basal C20r in Contessa section (Italy). [Berggren et al. (1995a); IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010)]
	c	44.12	dashed	Poor calibration.  Berggren et al. (1995a) estimate as upper Chron C20r (C20r.7).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) cite 44.0 Ma based on Bachman (1986), but chron-age not given.
	b	45.49		Composite Fig.7 of Agnini et al. (2006) indicates placement at Chron C20r.1 (used here).  IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 46.1 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing the same Agnini et al. (2006) but this is the base of Chron C20r on that CK'95 scale.
	a	46.29		Eocene Nanno Zone NP15-16 is combined in some zonal schemes, because marker of NP16 (base = LAD 'Rhabdolithus gladius') is rare or often absent.  [See Perch-Nielsen, 1985, for details.]   However, Aubry (in Berggren et al., 1995), could distinquish 3 subzones in NP15 using markers similar for subzones of CP13 (with a total duration of 4 m.y.), and estimated that NP16 was a valid zone with duration of nearly 3 m.y.
	b	47.84		FAD of B. inflatus = GSSP marker (Feb'11 ratification) = set as 39 precession cycles (used 20kyr cycles here) from base of Chron C21r in GSSP section (Molina et al., 2011) = middle of Chron C21r (prob. C21r.55), which is similar chron-age scaling in Berggren et al. (1995a).
	a	49.11		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 49.5 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2006) => Chron C21n.3 on that scale; used here.  This is just slightly younger than the chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of base of C22n.  The Lutetian GSSP nannofossils (Molina et al., Episodes, in press as of 2011) indicate the FAD may be as high as C21n.5.5.
	TOP	53.7		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 53.1 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C24n.3n.5 (used here).  This is about 0.25 older than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of the middle of Chron C24n.2r.
	b	54.17	dashed	DASH -- LAD of T. contortus is not seen very often, therefore IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) used FAD of Tri. orthostylus as alternate marker for base-NP11.  Eocene Nanno evolution from Tribrachiatus contortus to Tribrachiatus orthostylus was formerly described as an abundance shift, but Aubry has subdivided it into different morphotypes.  The event here was "Tribrachiatus contortus  (Morphotype B)".  Age assignment by Leg 320-321 of 53.5 Ma (on CK'95 scale) is based on Agnini et al. (2007) = Chron C24r.94 on that CK'95 scale (used here).  This essentially the same chron-age scaling as Berggren et al. (1995a) of ca. C24r.9.
	a	54.95		Agnini et al. (2007) assigned as Chron C24r.69 (used here); which is nearly same as relative chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995) of ca. Chron C24r.75.
	b	56.66		Base of Paleocene Nanno Zone CP8b concides with EITHER FAD of Romboaster spp, or FAD of C. eodela (either FAD of rare; or FAD of Common as used by Agnini et al'07).  Within Zone NP9 several species of Rhomboaster evolve, and can be used for a fine subdivision (see Perch-Nielsen, 1985).
	a	57.21		IODP Expedition 320/321 Scientists (2010) assigned as 56.0 Ma (based on CK'95 scale) citing Agnini et al. (2007) who placed it at Chron C25n.8 (chron placement used here).  This is slightly higher than chron-age scaling of Berggren et al. (1995a) of about Chron C25n.4.
	TOP	64.81		Middle of Chron C28r. [Berggren et al. (1995a)]
	b	65.47		This taxa might be C. intermedius (Paul Bown to J.Ogg, June2011).  Defines NP2 base.  Berggren et al. (1995a) assign as lower Chron C29n (C29n.3).
	a	66.04		Base of Cenozoic  (Chron C29r.5).  Zone NP1 begins with the acme of Thoracosphaera (calc. dinoflagellate), or is the interval from the top of the Cretaceous to the FAD of C. tenuis (base of NP2).
	TOP	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	b	100.45		Leg 171 observed as 2 precession cycles (0.05 myr) above base-Rotalipora globotruncanoides (base of Cenomanian); used here.  Jackie Lee assigned much higher -- 40% up in N. carcitanense subzone.  SEPM'98 assigned tropical FAD as middle of N. americanus Z.
	a	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	b	107.59		Coeval with FAD of foraminifer B. breggiensis by Bralower-Leckie (but see note on calibration of that datum).  Called E. cf. E. eximius in Bralower-Leckie chart.  Age assigned as 105 Ma in Leg 207 table (note on SEPM chart) => assigned as mid-A. intermedius ammonite subzone
	a	109.94		Base of nannofossil A. albianus (called "P." albianus in Grippo et al., 2004) is 23.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (9.5 myr) => 109.1 Ma.  This projects to base of P. steinmanni ammonite subzone, rather than to 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z. of SEPM98 column.
	c	110.73		Nomenclature is "phacelosus" in older literature, but others seem to be using "orionatus" now (e.g., Bralower, Burnett).  Bralower-Leckie charts places this FAD in middle of T. primula Foram Zone, but this would be inconsistent with cycle-scaling of overlying FAD of A. albianus (base of next higher NC zone), therefore placed at 25% up in this table.  SEPM'98 had assigned Tranolithus "phacelosus" FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z., or at same level as FAD of Axopodo. albianus.
	b	112.65		FAD is 30 cycles of 405 kyr below base of Cenomanian in Piobbico core (Huang et al., 2010).  GTS04 = Middle of H. planispira Foram Zone (LAD of T. bejaouensis to FAD of T. primula) on Bralower-Leckie (GSA Bull., 1997) chart.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as top of N. nolani Z., D. nodosocostatum s.z.
	a	112.95	dashed	DASH -- has taxonomy problems in the transitional trend to subcircular.  Base of this subcircular P. columnata is 30.75 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (12.45 myr) => 112.95 Ma = working definition for base of Albian.  (Primary control on Aptian-Albian interval!)    SEPM'98 has assigned as FAD as 2/10 up in L. tardefurcata Z., L. schrammeni s.z.; but coincides at Vohrum, Germany (used to set it)
	b	122.25		90% of G. ferrolensis Foram Zone (Bergen & Sikora), which is 90% between LAD of L. cabri and FAD of G. algeriana; which is about 2 myr higher than what would be implied by Leg 207 table relative placement.  Not on SEPM chart.  NOTE: LAD is just below (0.2 myr) the top of N. nolani Z., D. nodosocostatum s.z. (based on Leg 171 projected 114.2 Ma relative to 114.0 for FAD H. albiensis).   But, LAD on Leg 207 table was assigned as 3/4th up in D. furcata zone (based on projected placement of 117.3 Ma in Leg 207 table)
	a	123.88		Base E. floralis (base NC7A) is about 2/3rds up in L.cabri foram zone (in broad sense) = "Nannoconid Return event" (Erba, 2004, Marine Micro).  GTS04 = 121.9 Ma (2.1 myr above base-Aptian) (was 119.0 Ma in Leckie's chart), which sets base of D. furcata Zone.  Time-control point for scaling E. Aptian.  SEPM'98 had FAD projected to 8/10 up in D. forbesi Zone (= D. weisi)  on SEPM chart; but now projects much higher (base of D. furcata Zone)
	b	125.95		20% up in D. weissi (J. Bergen assignment; based on La Bedoule-Cassis section).  SEPM'98 has assigned as Probably equivalent to C. mexicana of some nannofossil wokers (J. Bergen, pers. commu., 2005).  Not on SEPM chart; but Leg 207 table implies an age about 0.5 myr older than FAD of E. floralis.
	a	126.4		Also called Rucinolithus irregularis.   95% up in Chron M1n.   SEPM'98 had assigned as just below (0.1 myr) the base of Aptian.
	e	127.31		50% up in Chron M1n (Bralower, 1993).  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD is 1/10 up in A. vandenheckii Z.
	d	130.08		35% up in Chron M3r (merger of Bralower's and Bergen's placements).  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Chron M3r; but LAD was middle of H. caillaudianus Z. in France.
	c	131.51	dashed	DASH:  Middle (75%) of Chron M5r [Bralower].  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD as 6/10 up in P. angulicostata auct. Z.
	b	131.94		Put as upper (80% up) Chron M7n.  Before, had as Middle of Chron M7r (J. Bergen), which is slightly lower (0.4 myr) than placement on SEPM chart.  The two taxa are combined by some specialists.  Bralower subdivides NC5 with this datum.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Chron M6r when correlated with Italian magnetostratigraphy or just below the top of B. balearis Z. when correlated with French ammonites (which are similar placements, when using the GTS2004 time scale).
	a	132.87	dashed	DASH:  55% up in S. sayni Zone.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Middle of S.sayni Z.



UC Zone (Lt. Cret.) 	block	40	210/217/221		off
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	UC20	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 suggests that there is diachroneity.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	UC19	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	UC18	71.01		Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL) shows this datum (base UC18) at about 15% up in B. sumensis Belemite Zone (and projects to C31r.2 at Gubbio; and used here).  Huber et al' project age as 70.6 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics = C31r.16 (nearly same as Voight). Burnett'98 schematicaly shows this LAD at about 1/3rd up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone of NW Europe; but Voight had lower.  DASH CC24 zone boundary:  Leg 207 uses this LAD for base-CC24, rather than T. phacelosus ("most workers consider it difficult to distinquish T. orionatus from T. phacelosus, and consider the later species as the senior synonym -- J. Self-Trail", cited in Huber et al'08).  SEPM'98 assigned LAD for Boreal as equivalent to 6/10 up in B. grandis Zone of N.Amer., which is nearly same timing.  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD for Tethyan at base of Maastrichtian. [GTS04 has used Relative-age to R. levis and as CC24 base.]  
	UC17	72.02		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. obtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); used here.  Voight et al. (EPSL, submitted) have the same relationship for Germany, but suggest the datum can significantly higher in Gubbio-Tercis (equivalent to TOP of obtusus instead).  Jim Bergen shows as mid-Early Maastrictian (and LAD of "parca parca" as mid-Late Campanina.  [also called "Aspidolithus parcus constrictus" -- SEPM chart?]
	UC16	75.93	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 value of about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements, and is used here.  EGI database calibrates as base of Upper Campanian (76.4 Ma in Tethyan; 76.3 Ma in Boreal).  However, in Boreal-realm studies, Jackie Lees (Burnett) assigns as upper Upper Campanian (ca. 74 Ma); and this offset is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL).  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD is middle of D. stevensoni Z.  Note: Husson et al. spells as "eximus" (not eximius; which is apparently a typo-error).
	UC15	80.97		Burnett'98 shows schematically as base of B. obtusus Zone of N. Amer. (= base of Middle Campanian)  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in S. hippocrepis II Z. 
	UC14	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.  Also called "Aspidolithus parcus parcus" in some schemes.   Base of preceeding B. parcus expansus is probably the "parca" one just above the boundary, and parca-parca occurs higher (J. Bergen 2005 pers. Commun.).
	UC13	83.2		Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis (sensu Burnett'98b) FAD is schematically by Burnett'98 shown as middle of S. leei III Zone of N. Amer.  [Rarely used by others]
	UC12	85.56	dashed	DASHED -- Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of Uintacrinus socialis CRINOID Zone (in Chalk).  SEPM'98 had assigned Just below (0.1 myr) the FAD of L. cayeuxii, but this LAD is significantly ABOVE in both base-Santonian sections (Ten Mile Creek; and Olazagutia in Spain).  Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992.  
	UC11	86.5		Assigned here as ca. 70% up in Magadiceramus crenelatus inoceramid zone, based on relative spacing of nannofossil events at Ten Mile Creek candidate for base-Santonian (although base of that zone is not established) for the higher L. cayeuxii compared to both events at Olazagutia (Spainish base-Santonian candidate).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 40% up in G. margae ammonite Zone. Subzone UC11a is very brief.  SEPM'98 had assigned Same age as FAD of R. anthorphorus; but these are separated in Burnett'98.
	UC10	89.77		Same as "Micula decussata".  Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone (used here).  FAD is Late/Middle Coniacian boundary in Leg 171 and Tethyan SEPM column; BUT placed at Middle/Early Coniacian in Boreal SEPM column.  
	UC9	91.78	dashed	DASHED -- has a long transition with different concepts of species FAD (Dave Watkins; at UCL working group, June 2011) => "sensu lato" used here for earlier FAD.   Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests this FAD is about 20% up in R. ornatissimum subzone of C. woollgari Zone (used here).  In contrast, SEPM'98 had assigned as Just below (0.1 myr) the Middle/Early Coniacian boundary in Tethyan column.   Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992. 
	UC8	92.99	dashed	DASHED -- For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	UC7	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	UC6	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors -- "rare but cute" (D.Watkins).  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo -- used here (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide; and this was the basis for assigning in Leg 171 (but Ogg's Leg 171 table was slightly lower).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense).  J. Bergen puts also at base of Turonian), but below LAD of R. asper.
	UC5	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	UC4	94.54		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 10% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  Leg 207 places just 0.1 myr below L. acutus LAD; which is only slightly higher.  Essentially, Zone UC4 is very very short!
	UC3	96.16		FAD of L. acutus occurs near Thatcher Limestone in Western Interior (Andy Gale, UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011) => In Conlinoceras tarrantense (=Conlinoceras gilberti) ammonite zone.  Assigned here as middle of that Zone.  Base of CC10 has dual-markers (M. decoratus; L. acutus).  SEPM'98 has assigned both as Middle of A. granerosense zone (used here); but Leg 207 projects age as base of Middle Cenomanian (~1 myr below)
	UC2	98.26		Called "G. obliquum" by some authors; but Burnett'98  indicates that true "obliquum" comes in within mid-UC2c, or about 1 myr higher.  Burnett'98 assigns as basal (but not base) of M. dixoni ammonite zone, so set as 5% up here.  However, it is mainly a cold-realm datum.
	UC1	100.45		Leg 171 observed as 2 precession cycles (0.05 myr) above base-Rotalipora globotruncanoides (base of Cenomanian); used here.  Jackie Lee assigned much higher -- 40% up in N. carcitanense subzone.  SEPM'98 assigned tropical FAD as middle of N. americanus Z.
	UC0 / BC27	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.


UC Subzone 	block	30	210/217/221	notitle	off
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	d	67.3		CC26b (or NC20d) begins with FAD of M. prinsii = Lower Chron 29r -- Huber et al'08 say "average mean" of 66.79 relative to GTS04 (= C30n.5, used here), although they had a misleading 65.79 "average mean" in their comment, which Brian Huber corrected for J.Ogg (June'11).  Leg 207 assigned as 0.4 myr before end-Cretaceous.  Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes); with Boreal FAD later than Tethyan (Von Salis, 1998, SEPM chart).  Assigned previously (1998) as simply 1 myr prior to end of Cretaceous (ODP Leg 171B assignment, and average of Tethyan/Boreal of von Salis).
	c	67.84	dashed	DASHED -- Set as same as FAD of N. frequens
	b	69		FAD of M. murus (base of Zone CC25c of Self-Trail'01) assigned by Huber et al'08 as 68.45 Ma (corrected) relative to GTS04 magnetics (upper Chron C31n) = C31n.3  DASH (partly from inconsistencies in their text):  Leg 207 assigned as 1.2 myr before end-Cretaceous (arbitrary equal-spacing of FADs of M. murus, N. frequens, and M. prinsii); but SEPM98 placement used in GTS04 was base Chron C31n).  DASHED -- Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes). 
	a	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 suggests that there is diachroneity.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	TOP	75.93	dashed	DASH -- Huber et al'08 value of about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements, and is used here.  EGI database calibrates as base of Upper Campanian (76.4 Ma in Tethyan; 76.3 Ma in Boreal).  However, in Boreal-realm studies, Jackie Lees (Burnett) assigns as upper Upper Campanian (ca. 74 Ma); and this offset is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL).  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD is middle of D. stevensoni Z.  Note: Husson et al. spells as "eximus" (not eximius; which is apparently a typo-error).
	d	76.82		Also known as Quadrum trifidum.  Huber et al'08 review and conclude C33n.55 (used here) is best calibration (76.29 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics; although their text says "C33n.65" -- we assumed their age model was correct, not text).  Bralower et al. (1995) suggest this is coeval with FAD of foraminifer G. calcarata (about 0.8 myr younger), which may indicate uncertainty in Campanian inter-correlations.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of Late Campanian (base D. nebrascense zone).  Slighly below base-Calcarata in Tanzania (Petrizzo et al'11).
	c	77.61		Also known as Quadrum sissingh.  Huber et al'08 cite Erba et al'95 as C33n.45; but their 77.10 Ma "relative to GTS04 magnetics" implies C33n.41 (used here).  Seems an arbitrary 1 myr below FAD of U. trifidum in Leg 171/207 tables.
	b	79		Just above base of C. plummera Foram Zone according to M. Petrizzo (June 2011 workshop notes) => assigned here as 0.2 myr above.  This FAD age-projection is very similar from estimate in ODP 171/207, which had coincided with mid-B. perplexus (late) zone.
	a	80.97		Burnett'98 shows schematically as base of B. obtusus Zone of N. Amer. (= base of Middle Campanian)  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in S. hippocrepis II Z. 
	d	81.21		Burnett'98 shows schematically as 50% up in Baculites sp. (smooth) Zone.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as much lower: ~0.1 myr above base of S.hippocrepi II zone in SEPM.
	c	81.25		Burnett'98 shows schematically as 20% up in Baculites sp. (smooth) Zone.  In SEPM'89 and ODP Leg 171, the LAD coincides with base of B. asperiformis N.Amer. ammonite zone; but calibration details are lacking.
	b	81.38		Also called "Aspidolithus parcus constrictus" in some schemes.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 60% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.   FAD in Leg 207 was implied to be middle of S. hippocrepis I zone (but they essentially placed it an even 1 myr above FAD of A. parcus).
	a	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.  Also called "Aspidolithus parcus parcus" in some schemes.   Base of preceeding B. parcus expansus is probably the "parca" one just above the boundary, and parca-parca occurs higher (J. Bergen 2005 pers. Commun.).
	TOP	85.56	dashed	DASHED -- Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of Uintacrinus socialis CRINOID Zone (in Chalk).  SEPM'98 had assigned Just below (0.1 myr) the FAD of L. cayeuxii, but this LAD is significantly ABOVE in both base-Santonian sections (Ten Mile Creek; and Olazagutia in Spain).  Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992.  
	c	86.38		Assigned here as ca. 85% up in Magadiceramus crenelatus inoceramid zone, based on Ten Mile Creek candidate for base-Santonian (although base of that zone is not established).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of P. serratomarginatus ammonite Zone.   In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 assigned FAD nearly 2 myr Higher -- just below top of C. saxitonianus-I. undulatoplicatus Zone in mid-Santonian !!   A lowermost-Santonian or uppermost-Coniacian (depending on future definition, and correlation to W.Interior ammonite usage) is supported by base-Santonian GSSP study, where L. cayeuxii is above base-D. asymetrica Foram Zone (the working definition of base-Santonian here; although age-calibration is uncertain), and just below the proposed macrofossil definition.  Estimates (SEPM, Leg 171/207) seem to converge on placement at Middle/Early Santonian boundary (base of C. vermiformis zone).   SEPM'98 had assigned Just above (0.1 myr) the LAD of S. septenarius; but order is opposite in Burnett's UC system.
	b	86.44	dashed	DASHED -- Subzone UC11a and UC11b are very brief, therefore this boundary event is placed mid-way to base of UC11c.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 70% up in G. margae ammonite Zone.
	a	86.5		Assigned here as ca. 70% up in Magadiceramus crenelatus inoceramid zone, based on relative spacing of nannofossil events at Ten Mile Creek candidate for base-Santonian (although base of that zone is not established) for the higher L. cayeuxii compared to both events at Olazagutia (Spainish base-Santonian candidate).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 40% up in G. margae ammonite Zone. Subzone UC11a is very brief.  SEPM'98 had assigned Same age as FAD of R. anthorphorus; but these are separated in Burnett'98.
	TOP	89.77		Same as "Micula decussata".  Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone (used here).  FAD is Late/Middle Coniacian boundary in Leg 171 and Tethyan SEPM column; BUT placed at Middle/Early Coniacian in Boreal SEPM column.  
	c	89.95		Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of F. petrocoriensis Zone.  Same as "B. lacunosa" and "Aspidolithus parcus expansus" of some authors.
	b	90.71		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 1/6th up in "super" S. neptuni Zone (version used in GTS04 includes "overlying" Prionocyclus germari Zone".
	a	91.78	dashed	DASHED -- has a long transition with different concepts of species FAD (Dave Watkins; at UCL working group, June 2011) => "sensu lato" used here for earlier FAD.   Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests this FAD is about 20% up in R. ornatissimum subzone of C. woollgari Zone (used here).  In contrast, SEPM'98 had assigned as Just below (0.1 myr) the Middle/Early Coniacian boundary in Tethyan column.   Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992. 
	b	92.26		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 25% up in R. kallesi subzone of C. woollgari Zone.
	a	92.99	dashed	DASHED -- For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	TOP	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	b?	93.73	dotted	DOTTED -- BELOW LAD of H. chiastia, or base of Archeocretea Foram zone (Mark Leckie and Dave Watkins at Pueblo) => uppermost Cenomanian.  In contrast, Burnett'98 assigns LAD to lowermost Turonian; middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/3rd up in super-zone of W. coloradoense) -- used here to retain a UC6 - subzone "b" in order for now.  In 'austral' province.  Base of subzone corresponds to extinction of Ceratolithina spp.  K. magnificus has its local FAD here in N. England.  Same as "E. eptapetalus" of Varol '92.  
	a	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors -- "rare but cute" (D.Watkins).  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo -- used here (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide; and this was the basis for assigning in Leg 171 (but Ogg's Leg 171 table was slightly lower).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense).  J. Bergen puts also at base of Turonian), but below LAD of R. asper.
	c	94.07		This is the 5-element Q. intermedium. Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in N. juddii Zone.
	b	94.2	dashed	DASHED -- LAD of Albianus is above LAD of foraminifer Cushmani (Petrizzo, UCL Cret foram-nanno workshop; June 2011) => put arbitrary 0.1 myr above that Foram LAD.  This is close to placement in Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 85% up in M. geslinianum Zone -- which switches the "usual observed" sequence of LAD of A. albianus occurring AFTER the LAD of R. asper (which is the basis of separate NK zones)
	a	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	b	94.44		Called "loriei" by some authors.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 45% up in M. geslinianum Zone.
	a	94.54		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 10% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  Leg 207 places just 0.1 myr below L. acutus LAD; which is only slightly higher.  Essentially, Zone UC4 is very very short!
	e	94.64		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 90% up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	d	94.79		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 2/3rds up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	c	95.02		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 1/3rd up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	b	95.93		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 25% up in A. rhotomagense Zone.
	a	96.16		FAD of L. acutus occurs near Thatcher Limestone in Western Interior (Andy Gale, UCL Cret nanno-foram workshop; June 2011) => In Conlinoceras tarrantense (=Conlinoceras gilberti) ammonite zone.  Assigned here as middle of that Zone.  Base of CC10 has dual-markers (M. decoratus; L. acutus).  SEPM'98 has assigned both as Middle of A. granerosense zone (used here); but Leg 207 projects age as base of Middle Cenomanian (~1 myr below)
	c	97.31		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in M. dixoni Zone.
	b	97.73	dashed	DASH -- "Shelf-preferring form, therefore subzone might not be determinable in oceanic sequences".  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 30% up in M. dixoni Zone.
	a	98.26		Called "G. obliquum" by some authors; but Burnett'98  indicates that true "obliquum" comes in within mid-UC2c, or about 1 myr higher.  Burnett'98 assigns as basal (but not base) of M. dixoni ammonite zone, so set as 5% up here.  However, it is mainly a cold-realm datum.
	c	99.94		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 70% up in N. carcitanense subzone.  Zone UC1c is very brief.
	b	100.03		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in N. carcitanense subzone.
	a	100.45		Leg 171 observed as 2 precession cycles (0.05 myr) above base-Rotalipora globotruncanoides (base of Cenomanian); used here.  Jackie Lee assigned much higher -- 40% up in N. carcitanense subzone.  SEPM'98 assigned tropical FAD as middle of N. americanus Z.
	b	100.84		Bown shows as 30% up in S. dispar Ammonite Zone (now interval from base M.rostratum to top M.perinflatum Zones), but found higher [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI], therefore assigned here as 60% up.  Could be higher (40% up in R. appenninica Foram Zone was in TSC-tropical of 2010).  SEPM'98 assigned as Middle of M. perinflatum subzone.
	a	103.13		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone at Col de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.

Boreal UC,BC,NJ,NT Nanno Zone 	block	50	149/205/210
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	UC20	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 shows that there is diachroneity.  Therefore, a divergent base-C20 is retained here between Tethyan and Boreal.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	UC19	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	UC18	70.94		Called "phacelosus" by most older publications, but Burnett and Leg 207 use "orionatus".  Burnett'98 schematicaly shows this LAD at about 1/3rd up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone of NW Europe.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in B. grandis Zone of N.Amer., which is nearly same timing.
	UC17	72.02		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. obtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  Jim Bergen shows as mid-Early Maastrictian (and LAD of "parca parca" as mid-Late Campanina).
	UC16	74.51	dashed	DASH -- Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 70% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here), or about middle of B. reesidei Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal LAD as 2/10 up in B. compressus Z.   For Tethys, Huber et al'08 calibrated it at about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements; and this offset of Boreal-Tethys is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL)..  EGI database calibrates as base of Upper Campanian (76.4 Ma in Tethyan; 76.3 Ma in Boreal).  
	UC15	80.97		Burnett'98 shows schematically as base of B. obtusus Zone of N. Amer. (= base of Middle Campanian)  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in S. hippocrepis II Z.  These two taxa are quite similar (and may be synonymous).
	UC14	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.
	UC13	83.2		Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis (sensu Burnett'98b) FAD is schematically by Burnett'98 shown as middle of S. leei III Zone of N. Amer.  [Rarely used by others]
	UC12	85.56		Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of Uintacrinus socialis CRINOID Zone (in Chalk); so I've arbitrarily put this at base of Middle Santonian.
	UC11	86.5		SAME as Tethyan.  Assigned here as 6% up in D. asym. Foram Zone (see discussion for L. cayeuxii).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 40% up in G. margae ammonite Zone. Subzone UC11a is very brief.  SEPM'98 had assigned Same age as FAD of R. anthorphorus; but these are separated in Burnett'98.
	UC10	89.77		Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone.
	UC9	91.78	dashed	DASHED -- has a long transition with different concepts of species FAD (Dave Watkins; at UCL working group, June 2011).   Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 20% up in R. ornatissimum subzone of C. woollgari Zone (used here).  In contrast, SEPM'98 had assigned as Just below (0.1 myr) the Middle/Early Coniacian boundary in Tethyan column.   Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992. 
	UC8	92.99		For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	UC7	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	UC6	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors.  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide); which was used in Leg 171 (ad used here).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense); but J. Bergen puts down to base of this zone (base of Turonian), and below LAD of R. asper.   Leg 171B placed relatively lower -- LAD projected at 3/4ths up in D. problimaticum Z.
	UC5	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	UC4	94.54		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 10% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  Leg 207 places just 0.1 myr below L. acutus LAD; which is only slightly higher.  Essentially, Zone UC4 is very very short!
	UC3	96.24		Burnett'98 assigns as base of C. inerme Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as slightly higher (by about 0.3 myr) as 25% up in T. costatus subzone of A. rhotomagense Zone.
	UC2	98.26		Called "G. obliquum" by some authors; but Burnett'98  indicates that true "obliquum" comes in within mid-UC2c, or about 1 myr higher.  Burnett'98 assigns as basal (but not base) of M. dixoni ammonite zone, so set as 5% up here.
	UC1	100.07		40% up in N. carcitanense subzone (Jackie Lee).  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 8/10 up in [blank] Z.
	BC27	103.27		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone, or about 1/3rd up in Ticensis Zone at ol de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	BC26	104.06		60% up in M. inflatum Zone
	BC25	108.31		Just below top (95%) of E. loricatus Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmani s.z.
	BC24	110.06	dashed	DASH at 25% up in H. dentatus Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmani s.z.
	BC23	111.91	dashed	DASH at middle of L. tardefurcata Zone (uncertainty ranges through entire zone).  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as top of L. tardefurcata Z., L. regularis s.z.
	BC22	116.23		Top of N. nolani subzone
	BC21	123.88	dashed	DASH at Base of T. bowerbanki Zone
	BC20	124.8	dashed	DASH at Middle of D. deshayesi Zone
	BC19	125.73	dashed	DASH at 95% up in D. forbesi Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in D. deshayesi Z.
	BC18	126.3		Base of P. fissicostatus Zone (base of Aptian)
	BC17	126.41		Just above base (5%) of P. bidentatum Zone.
	BC16	127.63		Just above base (5%) of A. inexum Zone.
	BC15	129.56		Just above base (5%) of P. elegans Zone.
	BC14	129.78		Base of H. fissicostatum Zone.
	BC13	130.77		Base of P. rarocinctum Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hugii Z.
	BC12	131.87		25% up in S. variabilis subzone.
	BC11	132.68		Middle of C. gottschei Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 5/10 up in P. ligatus Z.
	BC10	132.89		75% up in M. speetonensis Zone
	BC9	133.02		25% up in M. speetonensis Zone
	BC8	133.43		30% up in E. regale Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 8/10 up in C. loryi Z.

Boreal UC-BC Nanno Subzone 	block	30	149/205/210	notitle	off
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	d	66.61		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about middle of B. baltica / danica Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL) show base 20d slightly older relative to German belemnites, and correlates via C-13 to about Chron C30n.8 at Gubbio (used here).  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian
	c	66.86		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. argenta / junior Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).
	b	67.84		Huber et al'08 compute as 67.44 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics = C30n.14; which is close to the C30n.25 of Voight et al (submitted to EPSL) based on C13 correlations; therefore C30n.2 is used here.   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in B. argenta / junior Belemnite Zone (NW Europe), which is just slightly (0.2 myr) younger.   Burnett'98 states that N. frequens has a well-documented diachronous FO", which is youngest at northern high latitudes.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian; and a "younger" (high Boreal?) FAD as 5/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian.  Leg 207 assigned as 0.8 myr before end-Cretaceous => closer to Boreal placement on SEPM98.
	a	69.18		Lowermost Chron C31n, which Huber et al'08 interpolate as 68.70 Ma (GTS scale) = C31n.05.  However, Voight et al. (submitted to EPSL, June 2011) put it slightly higher (about C31n.15); therefore C31n.1 is used here.  Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. junior / tegulatus Belemnite Zone (NW Europe) = 68.48 Ma which is about 0.7 myr higher; and Voight '11 shows that there is diachroneity.  Therefore, a divergent base-C20 is retained here between Tethyan and Boreal.  SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".
	TOP	72.02		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. obtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  Jim Bergen shows as mid-Early Maastrictian (and LAD of "parca parca" as mid-Late Campanina).
	d	72.18		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in B. pseudobtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  HOWEVER, Jim Bergen inverts this sequence, with this M.quarternarius LAD BELOW T. caistorensis LAD (hence, at end of Campanian).
	c	72.28		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. pseudobtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 4/10 up in B. eliasi Z.
	b	73.36		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 90% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as top of B. jenseni Z.
	a	74.51	dashed	DASH -- Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 70% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here), or about middle of B. reesidei Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal LAD as 2/10 up in B. compressus Z.   For Tethys, Huber et al'08 calibrated it at about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements; and this offset of Boreal-Tethys is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al. (2011, submitted to EPSL)..  EGI database calibrates as base of Upper Campanian (76.4 Ma in Tethyan; 76.3 Ma in Boreal).  
	e	77.08		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 25% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here; with "langei" refering to broad zone, omitting "g/g"), or at about middle of B. compressus Zone of N. Amer.  Problem is how the NW Europe belemnites correlate to N.Amer. ammonites.  HOWEVER, Jim Bergen assigned O. campanensis LAD as ABOVE E. eximius LAD.
	d	78.75		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 50% up in B. minor Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here), or about middle of B. stevensoni Zone of N. Amer. (which is much higher).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD as nearly 5 myr Older at 4/10 up in B. sp. (smooth) Z.
	c	79.01		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about middle of "B. perplexus" Zone of N. Amer., but only the lower one is used here to avoid overlap with "d" above (in boreal subzones).
	b	80.3		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 80% up in B. maclearni Zone of N. Amer. 
	a	80.97		Burnett'98 shows schematically as base of B. obtusus Zone of N. Amer. (= base of Middle Campanian)  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in S. hippocrepis II Z.  These two taxa are quite similar (and may be synonymous).
	b	81.38		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 60% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer. 
	a	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.
	b	82.76		Burnett'98 shows schematically as base of S. hippocrepis I Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as just above base of Campanian.
	a	83.2		Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis (sensu Burnett'98b) FAD is schematically by Burnett'98 shown as middle of S. leei III Zone of N. Amer.  [Rarely used by others]
	TOP	85.56		Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of Uintacrinus socialis CRINOID Zone (in Chalk); so I've arbitrarily put this at base of Middle Santonian.
	c	86.38		SAME as Tethyan.  Assigned here as 12% up in D. asymetrica Foram zone.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of P. serratomarginatus ammonite Zone.   In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 assigned FAD nearly 2 myr Higher -- just below top of C. saxitonianus-I. undulatoplicatus Zone in mid-Santonian !!   A lowermost-Santonian or uppermost-Coniacian (depending on future definition, and correlation to W.Interior ammonite usage) is supported by base-Santonian GSSP study, where L. cayeuxii is above base-D. asymetrica Foram Zone (the working definition of base-Santonian here; although age-calibration is uncertain), and just below the proposed macrofossil definition.  Estimates (SEPM, Leg 171/207) seem to converge on placement at Middle/Early Santonian boundary (base of C. vermiformis zone).   SEPM'98 had assigned Just above (0.1 myr) the LAD of S. septenarius; but order is opposite in Burnett's UC system.
	b	86.44		SAME as Tethyan.  Assigned here as 9% up in D. asym. Foram Zone (see discussion for L. cayeuxii).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 70% up in G. margae ammonite Zone.  Subzone UC11b is very brief.
	a	86.5		SAME as Tethyan.  Assigned here as 6% up in D. asym. Foram Zone (see discussion for L. cayeuxii).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 40% up in G. margae ammonite Zone. Subzone UC11a is very brief.  SEPM'98 had assigned Same age as FAD of R. anthorphorus; but these are separated in Burnett'98.
	TOP	89.77		Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone.
	c	89.95		Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of F. petrocoriensis Zone.  Same as "B. lacunosa" and "Aspidolithus parcus expansus" of some authors.
	b	90.71		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 1/6th up in "super" S. neptuni Zone (version used in GTS04 includes "overlying" Prionocyclus germari Zone".
	a	91.78	dashed	DASHED -- has a long transition with different concepts of species FAD (Dave Watkins; at UCL working group, June 2011).   Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 20% up in R. ornatissimum subzone of C. woollgari Zone (used here).  In contrast, SEPM'98 had assigned as Just below (0.1 myr) the Middle/Early Coniacian boundary in Tethyan column.   Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992. 
	b	92.26		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 25% up in R. kallesi subzone of C. woollgari Zone.
	a	92.99		For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	TOP	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	b?	93.73	dotted	DOTTED -- BELOW LAD of H. chiastia, or base of Archeocretea Foram zone (Mark Leckie and Dave Watkins at Pueblo) => uppermost Cenomanian.  In contrast, Burnett'98 assigns LAD to lowermost Turonian; middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/3rd up in super-zone of W. coloradoense) -- used here to retain a UC6 - subzone "b" in order for now.  In 'austral' province.  Base of subzone corresponds to extinction of Ceratolithina spp.  K. magnificus has its local FAD here in N. England.  Same as "E. eptapetalus" of Varol '92.  
	a	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors.  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide); which was used in Leg 171 (ad used here).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense); but J. Bergen puts down to base of this zone (base of Turonian), and below LAD of R. asper.   Leg 171B placed relatively lower -- LAD projected at 3/4ths up in D. problimaticum Z.
	c	94.07		This is the 5-element Q. intermedium. Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in N. juddii Zone.
	b	94.2	dashed	DASHED -- LAD of Albianus is above LAD of foraminifer Cushmani (Petrizzo, UCL Cret foram-nanno workshop; June 2011) => put arbitrary 0.1 myr above that Foram LAD.  This is close to placement in Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 85% up in M. geslinianum Zone -- which switches the "usual observed" sequence of LAD of A. albianus occurring AFTER the LAD of R. asper (which is the basis of separate NK zones)
	a	94.39	dashed	DASHED -- Rare, and difficult to use (comments at UCL Cret. nanno-foram workshop; June 2011).  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 60% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  LAD assigned as ~0.5 myr below top of Cenomanian, which is same.
	b	94.44		Called "loriei" by some authors.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 45% up in M. geslinianum Zone.
	a	94.54		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 10% up in M. geslinianum Zone.  Leg 207 places just 0.1 myr below L. acutus LAD; which is only slightly higher.  Essentially, Zone UC4 is very very short!
	e	94.64		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 90% up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	d	94.79		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 2/3rds up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	c	95.02		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 1/3rd up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	b	95.93		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 25% up in A. rhotomagense Zone.
	a	96.24		Burnett'98 assigns as base of C. inerme Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as slightly higher (by about 0.3 myr) as 25% up in T. costatus subzone of A. rhotomagense Zone.
	c	97.31		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in M. dixoni Zone.
	b	97.73		Shelf-preferring form, therefore subzone might not be determinable in oceanic sequences".  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 30% up in M. dixoni Zone.
	a	98.26		Called "G. obliquum" by some authors; but Burnett'98  indicates that true "obliquum" comes in within mid-UC2c, or about 1 myr higher.  Burnett'98 assigns as basal (but not base) of M. dixoni ammonite zone, so set as 5% up here.
	c	99.94		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 70% up in N. carcitanense subzone.  Zone UC1c is very brief.
	b	100.03		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 50% up in N. carcitanense subzone.
	a	100.07		40% up in N. carcitanense subzone (Jackie Lee).  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 8/10 up in [blank] Z.
	c	100.54	dotted	DOTTED -- Only see in North Sea.  80% up in S. dispar Zone.  Was suggested as datum for a base of Zone "BC27c", but probably too rare to be useful [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI]
	b	100.69		Bown shows as 30% up in S. dispar Zone, but found higher [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI], therefore assigned here as 70% up.  Could be higher (40% up in R. appenninica Foram Zone was in TSC-tropical of 2010).  SEPM'98 assigned as Middle of M. perinflatum subzone.
	a	103.27		2 events are used, depending on morphotype.  Small is earlier.  Large (USED HERE) is base of M. fallax ammonite zone, or about 1/3rd up in Ticensis Zone at ol de Palluel (Gale et al., 2011) (used here, because have cycle-strat for that foram zone).  Bown'98 has schematically shown as 90% up in M. inflatum Zone, which is same numerical-age level.  Bralower-Leckie, 1997, had put slightly lower -- coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis.  SEPM'98 assigned Boreal FAD as 7/10 up in E. loricatus Z., E. meandrinus s.z.  or Tropical as just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.
	TOP	104.06		60% up in M. inflatum Zone
	b	107.29		Near base (5% up) in M. inflatum Zone
	a	108.31		Just below top (95%) of E. loricatus Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmani s.z.

	b	132.54		Base of S. marginatus subzone

	TOP	133.02		25% up in M. speetonensis Zone
	c	133.13		85% up in S. inversum Zone.  P.Bown uses Peri. plethotretus FAD to define base of brief BC8c subzone.
	b	133.38		75% up in E. regale Zone.  P.Bown uses to define base of brief BC8b subzone.
	a	133.43		30% up in E. regale Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 8/10 up in C. loryi Z.

	a	138.32		Base of P. heteropleurum subzone (middle of Polyptyhites Zone).  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. pertransiens Z.
	a	138.76		75% up in P. albidum Zone.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 1/10 up in T. pertransiens Z.


Boreal NK Nanno zones 	block	30	149/205/210		off
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	NK1 - 2	67.84		Huber et al'08 compute as 67.44 Ma relative to GTS04 magnetics = C30n.14; which is close to the C30n.25 of Voight et al (submitted to EPSL) based on C13 correlations; therefore C30n.2 is used here.   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in B. argenta / junior Belemnite Zone (NW Europe), which is just slightly (0.2 myr) younger.   Burnett'98 states that N. frequens has a well-documented diachronous FO", which is youngest at northern high latitudes.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian; and a "younger" (high Boreal?) FAD as 5/10 up between top of J. nebrascensis Z. and end of Maastrichtian.  Leg 207 assigned as 0.8 myr before end-Cretaceous => closer to Boreal placement on SEPM98.
	NK3 - 5	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	NK6	70.94		Called "phacelosus" by most older publications, but Burnett and Leg 207 use "orionatus".  Burnett'98 schematicaly shows this LAD at about 1/3rd up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone of NW Europe.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 6/10 up in B. grandis Zone of N.Amer., which is nearly same timing.
	NK7	72.02		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. obtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  Jim Bergen shows as mid-Early Maastrictian (and LAD of "parca parca" as mid-Late Campanina).
	NK8	77.08		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 25% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here; with "langei" refering to broad zone, omitting "g/g"), or at about middle of B. compressus Zone of N. Amer.  Problem is how the NW Europe belemnites correlate to N.Amer. ammonites.  HOWEVER, Jim Bergen assigned O. campanensis LAD as ABOVE E. eximius LAD.
	NK9 - 12A	85.97		Burnett'98 notes that "consistent occurrence of rare to frequent Calculites obscurus has been recorded in this zone (UC11c), but cannot be relied on as a datum since the form has been observed to occur well below this level, albeit sporadically and very rarely (as has Calculites ovalis)."  Placed here as "FCO" and arbitrarily in middle of Zone UC11c.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD much higher, as top of C. choteauensis Zone.
	NK13B	89.77		In GSSP proposal; the Top of H. tursnicus in Poland is at the GSSP.  Therefore, age is assigned as base-Coniacian (pending that definition; but assumed to be equivalent to N.Amer. working definition).
	NK14 A-C	92.99		For now, FAD of E. eximius assigned as assigned as 80% up in M. nodosoides Zone (from schematic diagram in Burnett'98).  Also put as coeval with foram H. helvetica LAD; but it seems diachronous relative to LAD of H. helvetica (above LAD at Demerara Rise Leg 207; within Helvetica zone at Tanzania and S. Atl.  Pueblo (USA) => can get cyclestrat for both events (Dave Watkins; but he needs to check it).   SEPM'98 assigned FAD at about 1 myr higher.  Dual-markers (Eiffellithus eximius, Lucianorhabdus maleformis) for base of CC12; but separated in Burnett'98.  SEPM'98 had assigned both FADs as middle of P. percarinatus Z.
	NK14 D	93.55	dashed	DASH:  "Just above base-Turonian at top of Devonense Zone (Dave Watkins; UCL Cret nanno workshop; June 2011) -- used here.  This is lower (by about 0.5 myr) than schematic diagram in Burnett'98, which suggests about 1/3rd up in M. nodosoides Zone.  This is similar to placement at Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.  In contrast, Boreal column in SEPM'98 had placed Q. garneri FAD as much lower -- in Cenomanian (!!) at 4/10 up in N. juddii Z.  
	NK16 - 17	94.2	dashed	DASHED -- LAD of Albianus is above LAD of foraminifer Cushmani (Petrizzo, UCL Cret foram-nanno workshop; June 2011) => put arbitrary 0.1 myr above that Foram LAD.  This is close to placement in Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 85% up in M. geslinianum Zone -- which switches the "usual observed" sequence of LAD of A. albianus occurring AFTER the LAD of R. asper (which is the basis of separate NK zones)
	NK18	94.79		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 2/3rds up in C. guerangeri Zone.
	NK19	100.5	dotted	DOTTED:  Mortimer's NK19 base is LCO of S. primitivum and B. ellipticum; but these are not tabulated by Bown'98, SEPM or Jim Bergen. Put arbitrarily here at base of Cenomanian -- need to eventually find calibrations.


Boreal KN Nanno zones 	block	30	149/205/210		off
	TOP	66.04		Top of Cretaceous
	KN1 - 5	70.14		A calibration of Chron C31r.6 is used here.  Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.
	KN6 - 7	72.02		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. obtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  Jim Bergen shows as mid-Early Maastrictian (and LAD of "parca parca" as mid-Late Campanina).
	KN8 - 9	72.28		Burnett'98 schematically shows as base of B. pseudobtusa Belemnite Zone (NW Europe).  SEPM'98 assigned LAD as 4/10 up in B. eliasi Z.
	KN10 - 13	77.08		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 25% up in B. langei Belemnite zone of NW Europe (used here; with "langei" refering to broad zone, omitting "g/g"), or at about middle of B. compressus Zone of N. Amer.  Problem is how the NW Europe belemnites correlate to N.Amer. ammonites.  HOWEVER, Jim Bergen assigned O. campanensis LAD as ABOVE E. eximius LAD.
	KN14 - 19	79.73	dashed	DASH -- Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. asperiformis Zone of N. Amer., but notes that LAD is partially paleolatitude dependent.
	KN20	81.38		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 60% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer. 
	KN21	81.43		Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 40% up in S. hippocrepis III Zone of N. Amer.  SEPM'98 assigned FAD as 3/10 up in S. hippocrepis I Zone.  Subzone UC14a is very brief.
	KN22 - 24	85.56		Same as L. "moratus" of Varol, 1992.  Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about base of Uintacrinus socialis CRINOID Zone (in Chalk); so I've arbitrarily put this at base of Middle Santonian.
	KN25 - 29	89.77		Burnett'98 assigns as essentially at base of P. tridorsatum Zone.
	KN30 - 34	92.99	dashed	DASH:  Burnett'98 "FO of consistently-occurring K. magnificus lies areound the FO of E. eximius."  Not in Leg 207 table or SEPM chart; but highlighted by Bralower-Leckie as base of NC14 with assigned age of 91.8 Ma (using Gradstein et al., 1994 scale), which projects as 5% up in C. woollgari Zone.  However, FAD ranges as low as lower-Lower Turonian and as high as lower-Middle Turonian (Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI]
	KN35 - 38	93.9		Same as "Microstaurus chiastius" of other authors.  LAD occurs at GSSP level in Pueblo (Dave Watkins; citing a field trip guide); which was used in Leg 171 (ad used here).  Burnett'98 assigns LAD only slightly higher -- as middle of W. devonense Zone (or, about 1/6th up in super-zone of W. coloradoense); but J. Bergen puts down to base of this zone (base of Turonian), and below LAD of R. asper.   Leg 171B placed relatively lower -- LAD projected at 3/4ths up in D. problimaticum Z.
	KN39	94.2	dashed	DASHED -- LAD of Albianus is above LAD of foraminifer Cushmani (Petrizzo, UCL Cret foram-nanno workshop; June 2011) => put arbitrary 0.1 myr above that Foram LAD.  This is close to placement in Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 85% up in M. geslinianum Zone -- which switches the "usual observed" sequence of LAD of A. albianus occurring AFTER the LAD of R. asper (which is the basis of separate NK zones)
	KN40	95.93		Schematic diagram in Burnett'98 suggests about 25% up in A. rhotomagense Zone.

Watkins has calibrated it as 1 precession cycle below a 70.06 Ma Ar-Ar age (hence 70.08, ignoring uncertainty on Ar-Ar age).   Burnett'98 schematically shows as about 85% up in B. sumensis Belemnite Zone (NW Europe); but Voight et al (2011, submitted to EPSL) show it as midway in that Zone, synchronous with Gubbio, and correlate to about Chron C31r.5 (70.3 Ma in GTS2012 magnetics).  "Just above the FAD of planktonic foraminifer R. fructosa" (Huber et al'08, who placed it 0.18 myr above = 69.9 Ma in GTS2012 foram scaling based on Huber et al's tables).  Bralower et al (1995) suggest using this LAD to subdivide NC21 into a/b subzones; but the GTS2004 ages would imply very short durations, so omitted here.  ODP age is 69.8 Ma, but EGI database (2005) calibrates as much higher at 68.4 Ma (North Sea) and 68.6 (Tethys).  This younger age would probably require the overlying succession to also be pushed "higher" to retain same sequence.  SEPM'98 assigned LAD in Tethys as top of H. ricolleti Zone of N.Amer., which is about 1 myr Higher.   SEPM'98 had assigned LAD in Boreal as top of B. clinolobatus (base of H. birkelundi) ammonite = Late/Early Maastr. boundary.<br> [For details at Nannotax, click <a href="http://nannotax.org/category/mesozoic/overview/eiffellithales/chiastozygaceae/reinhardtites/reinhardtites-levis">Reinhardtites levis</a> ].

For Tethys, Huber et al'08 calibrated it at about 75.31 Ma (C33n.71 relative to GTS04 magnetics) seems consistent with other Tethyan placements; and this offset of Boreal-Tethys is verified in cross-region C-13 studies by Voight et al.

Saurischians	:	Therapods (carnivores)	Sauropods (herbivores)		Suborder Saurischia ("lizard-hipped" dinosaurs) can be divided into 2 main groups on the basis of what they ate: the flesh-eating Therapods that walked upright on 2 legs, and the plant-eating Sauropods that moved about on all four legs.

Therapods (carnivores)	:	Carnivorous dinosaurs -- small (Coelurosaurs)	Carnivorous dinosaurs -- medium-sized (Deinonychosaurs)	Carnivorous dinosaurs -- large (Carnosaurs)		Suborder Theropoda (flesh-eating dinosaurs) are subdivided into 3 "infraorders" according to size: small, light-weight as Infraorder Coelurosauria (meaning "hollow-tailed lizards" referring to the thin-walled hollow bones that made up their tales and most of their bodies), medium with killing claws on hind feet as Infraorder Deinonychosauria (meaning "terrible-clawed lizards"), and large massive Infraorder Carnosauria (meaning "flesh-eating lizards")

Sauropods (herbivores)	:	Early herbivorous dinosaurs (Prosauropods)	Long-necked browsing dinosaurs (Sauropods)		Suborder Sauropodomorpha is largely made up of 4-legged herbivores, and is divided into "infraorders" according to size. "Prosauropoda" ("Before the Sauropods") consists of the smaller types, while "Sauropoda" consists of the more well-known, gigantic, plant eating dinosaurs.

Carnivorous dinosaurs -- small (Coelurosaurs)	range		200/180/255		on	Suborder Theropoda (flesh-eating dinosaurs) are subdivided into 3 "infraorders" according to size: small, light-weight as Infraorder Coelurosauria (meaning "hollow-tailed lizards" referring to the thin-walled hollow bones that made up their tales and most of their bodies), medium with killing claws on hind feet as Infraorder Deinonychosauria (meaning "terrible-clawed lizards"), and large massive Infraorder Carnosauria (meaning "flesh-eating lizards")

	Middle Paleolithic	0.08		Mousterian (defines Middle Paleozoic) is from about 80,000 years ago to about 40,000 years ago.  Named from Neandertal sites.  Called Aterian in Africa.  "Marked by the progressive reduction in the use of large core tools, such as hand axes, as specialized flake tools became more common."  Named after the site of le Moustier in France; this enhancement of the Levallois-style prepared core technique was especially developed by Neandertals (and ended with their extinction).

	Levallois	0.3		The Levallois technique for making stone tools was carefully preparing a core, and then flaking off uniform tools of a desired shape and size by pressure-flaking producing a tool convex on one side and relatively flat on the other--i.e., a Levallois flake.  This technique was first used by archaic humans around 300,000 years ago, and perfected in the Mousterian Tradition by the Neandertals.

ANTHRO Website= <a href="http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/mod_homo_2.htm">Neander</a>. NAME MEANING= Latin "Homo", meaning man, and the Neander Valley in Gernamy where the first major specimen was discovered (the German word for Valley being "Tal" or "Thal" and thus giving "Neadnerthal", or "Man from the Neander Valley").. DESCRIPTION= Related, but not a direct ancestor to Homo sapiens. Thought to have evolved in Europe from European Homo heidelbergensis around 300 kya. They were well adapted to cold and dry environments, being shorter and stockier than modern humans. They had an average cranial capacity of 1500 ml, compared to modern human's average of 1350. This may also have been an adaptation to the cold, as populations that live in colder climates are known to have larger brains. They also had a thick brow ridge, receeding forehead, an occipital bun, and a depression called the "suprainic fossa" where strong neck muscles would have been attached. Their bones were thicker and stronger than modern humans, their teeth were larger, and their pelvises were wider. Their DNA has also been studied, and genes for red hair, pale skin, and even genes related to language ability have been found.. DIET= They ate large amounts of meat supplimented with vegetable matter. However, despite this mixed diet, many Neadnerthal skeletons show evidence of nutrient deficiency. There is also some debatable evidence of cannibalism.. CULTURE= Associated with the Mousterian tool technology, however near the end of their time, they developed more advanced stone tool technology similar to the microblade technology used by early Homo sapiens.  This happened roughly at the same time that modern humans first entered Europe.  It is thought that they learned to make these tools by copying Homo sapiens, or they traded for them. Neanderthals had control of fire for cooking, heat, and protection from wild animals. They wore skins for clothes, especially in colder areas, however these skins were probably wrapped around the body and tied in place.  They were also known to occasionally wear jewelry such as pendants and other limited types of body decoration.  They seem to have buried their dead most of the time, and some artifacts have been discovered that might have been grave goods, however it is still difficult to say if this was ritualized behavior or not.  ENVIRONMENT= The Neanderthals lived in a variety of environments and across multiple periods of warming and cooling.  LOCATION= Europe and the Middle East.  Important sites include Le Moustier, La Ferrassie, and La Chapelle-aux-saints in France, Amud in Israel, and the Neander Valley in Germany. Another possible specimen has also been found in Maba, China.

Fossils are found in a broad range of locations including sites at Kabwe, Ndutu, and Bodo in Africa, Boxgrove, Steinhelm, and Mauer in Europe, and Dali, Maba, and Narmada in Asia.. DIET= They seem to have eaten large amounts of meat, preferring to hunt larger animals such as rhinos, bears, horses, and deer.. CULTURE= Later Homo heidelbergensis populations are associated with the Levallios stone tool technology, a method of stone working where a core is carefully prepared, and flakes of a uniform size and shape are chipped off. They are also known to have used tools made from antler, bone, and wood. Early Homo heidelbergensis used much the same technology as Homo erectus, where large stone tools were made by removing flakes from both sides to make a bifacial hand axe, cleaver, or carver. Homo heidelbergensis seems to have used these tools primarily for hunting and butchering animals. They use fire, however it is difficult to say whether it was a controlled use of fire or not. While there is no direct evidence of clothing, it seems likely that they wore hides to keep warm, especially in Europe where it was colder.. ENVIRONMENT= 600-200 kya, Europe and Africa went through a series of cool and warm phases. The move to Europe from Africa would have further introduced Homo heidelbergensis to colder climates as well. Approximately 300 kya there was a severe cold and dry period, during which the Sahara expanded, becoming a barrier to travel between Eurasia and Africa. It was during this time that regional differences began to occur.. LOCATION= Sites at Kabwe, Ndutu, and Bodo in Africa, Boxgrove, Steinhelm, and Mauer in Europe, and Dali, Maba, and Narmada in Asia..

Fossils attributed to this species date between 1.78 and 1.3 million years old. Average cranial capacity was 860 ml, and they are usually considered as having been tall and slender, however some remains show that at least females may have been broad hipped and short. The rib cage was barrel shaped like modern human's instead of cone shaped like previous hominins. The jaw was lighter and shorter than previous hominins, and so the face was shorter and flatter. The pelvis was shaped like a modern human's, however female hips seem to share many traits with Australopithecus afarensis, in that they are quite broad hipped. The legs were also longer than the arms, so their proportions were similar to those of modern humans..DIET= Likely they ate more meat than previous hominins, as well as tubers and other vegetable matter..CULTURE= Homo ergaster would have used Acheuean tool technology, including hand axes, cleavers, and picks. To make these tools, large flakes were shaped bifacially to make sharp edges. These tools were used primarily on meat, bone, animal hide, and wood.

(SEPM charts, 1998), Paleozoic = Haq and Schutter (Science, 2008) with Seq-stage-nomenclature by ExxonMobil group (Chengjie Liu et al., Jan'08, who also modified some of the previous SEPM nomenclature for Ceno-Mesozoic)
		MFS	0	Major	A major transgression-MFS is indicated for Today, which presumes continued melting of glaciers will exceed the Eemian previous maximum highstand.
	LGM	SB	0.02	Major	Last Glacial Maximum; Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2
		MSF	0.13	Major	Base of Eemian stage; MIS 5
	MI 6	SB	0.14	Major	Peak of Illinoian/Saalian glacial; MIS 6
		MFS	0.24	Medium	Onset of main pulse of interglacial MIS 7 MSF after glacial MIS 8
	MIS8	SB	0.27	Medium	Glacial MIS 8.
		MFS	0.42	Medium	Interglacial MIS 11 MSF after glacial MIS 10
	MIS12	SB	0.44	Major	Glacial MIS 12 (approx.) = major peak.  Glacial MIS 10 and 14 are lesser shifts than MIS 12 or MIS 16, therefore are omitted here.
		MFS	0.62	Medium	Onset of major interglacial MIS 15 MSF after glacial MIS 16
	MIS16	SB	0.64	Major	Glacial MIS 16 (approx.).  Glacial MIS 18 on isotope curve is lesser than either M22 or M16; therefore omitted here.
		MFS	0.84	Medium	Est. interglacial MSF after glacial MIS 22
	MIS22	SB	0.86	Major	Glacial MIS 22.  Oldest major peak on O-18 curve.  Just below base of Brunhes Normal.  Was called "Oi 1" on SEPM chart, but Pleistocene subcomm doesn't recommend an "Ionian" stage for global use.
		MFS	0.95	Minor	SEPM chart has at approximate mid-point of Sequence "Cala 2".  This seems rather arbitrary, because a full suite of glacial/interglacial oscillations are underway; and a re-assignment to the mor pronounced interglacial MIS 25 (0.95 Ma; just above base of Jaramillo normal-polarity chron), which as a relatively higher "peak" suggesting increased highstand, is used here.  This also corresponds to base of Italian "Ionian Stage".
	MIS52 (Cala2)	SB	1.54	Medium	SEPM chart shows as slightly below (0.15 myr) Middle of Foram Zone N22a.  Uncertain re-calibration to marine isotope stages; but might be glacial MIS 52 (1.54 Ma), which has a slightly higher magnitude than adjacent peaks.
		MFS	1.61	Medium	SEPM chart places this MFS at about only 0.05 myr above Cala 1 SB.   Uncertain re-calibration to marine isotope stages; but might be interglacial MIS 55-57 (~1.64-1.59 Ma) as appearing to be a more extended inter-glacial lowstand.  This also corresponds to approximate base of "Emilian substage" of Italian "Calabrian stage".
	MIS58 (Cala1)	SB	1.65	Medium	SEPM chart seems to place as an arbitrarily 0.16 myr older than Cala 2 SB.  Assigned here as glacial MIS 58, which has a relatively greater "negative" shift, suggesting a more pronounced lowstand.
		MFS	1.76	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 0.05 myr below Cala 1 SB.  Assigned here to interglacial MIS 63, a more pronounced peak at end of Olduvai normal-polarity zone, which is aobut 0.1 myr older than major glacial MIS 58.
	Ge2	SB	2.16	Medium	SEPM chart places as slightly above (0.13 myr) Middle of Nanno Zone NN18 or CN12d.  This is close to major glacial MIS 82 (2.16 Ma), which is used here.
		MFS	2.39	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 3/4ths from base of Ge 1 sequence.  Assigned here as interglacial MIS 89, which is the oldest of a set of relatively pronounced interglacials (and implied highstands).
	Ge1	SB	2.5	Medium	Base Nanno Zone NN17 or CN12c  (LAD of nanno Discoaster surculus).  This corresponds closely to major glacial  MIS 100, and this assignment is used here.
		MFS	2.59	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 0.05 myr below Ge 1 SB.    Re-assigned here as interglacial MIS 103, a major and relatively extended interglacial (and implied lowstand) which defines base of Gelasian stage.  [NOTE:  The glacial MIS 110 (about 0.15 myr before MIS 103) is also a major lowstand, which could be inserted as an additional Sequence below this MFS].
	Pia2	SB	2.8	Medium	Base Nanno Zone CN12b (LAD of nanno Discoaster tamalis).  Corresponds to glacial MIS 114.   Termination of Pliocene transgressive trend (due to onset of major glacials).
		MFS	2.92	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 3/4ths from base of Pia 1 sequence.  Marine isotope curve suggests this is a very broad highstand, and spans most of "Sequence Pia 1".  This highstand is termination of Pliocene transgressive trend; which is a "Medium" MSF on long-term trend.
	Pia1	SB	3.27	Medium	Slightly below (0.05 myr) Middle of Nanno Zone CN12a (=NN16a).  Corresponds to MIS "M2", which is the middle of subchron C2An.2r (Mammoth Reversed chron) in Italian cycle-strat section.
		MFS	3.82	Medium	Hardenbol's SEPM chart displays as only 0.03 above ZA 2 SB (nearly coincident with SB).  However, causes distortion with display => shifted to 25% up in SB.
	Za2	SB	4.01	Medium	SEPM chart displays as just below base of Nanno zone CN11 (=NN15 =LAD D. tricorniculatus).  Recalibration of this Nanno event to cycles places age significantly older (by 0.5 myr).  This correlation via Nannos could be a SB corresponding to Marine Isotope event N2 or N4, with ages of about 4.6 Ma.  Allternataively, the SB corresponds to event Gi16 at about 30% up in Chron C2Ar (middle of Nanno zone CN11b; at 4.0 Ma -- used here).  Need better information on primary calibration of this sequence boundary.
		MFS	4.16	Medium	Arbitrarily drawn as 3/4ths from base of Za 1 sequence
	Za1	SB	4.62	Minor	SEPM chart could be interpreted as placement in Middle of Foram Zone PL1b; but revised correlation of Nanno zone CN11 would make same the higher Za 2 SB.  Therefore, a calibration relative to Nannos is used here:  4/5ths up in CN10c.  Perhaps the primary calibration is Marine Isotope event S16 or S14 (near middle of Nanno Zone 10c; 4.9 Ma)?
		MFS	5.47	Major	Middle of Nanno Zone CN10a
	Me2	SB	5.77	Major	Middle of Nanno Zone NN11d (CN9d) = midway between LAD of nanno Discoaster quinqueramus and LAD of Amaurolithus amplificus.  This lowstand is minimum of Late Miocene regression; which is a "medium" SB on long-term scale.
		MFS	5.99	Medium	Just below (0.05 myr) Top of Nanno zone NN11c (top of CN9c = LAD N. amplificus).
	Me1	SB	7.26	Minor	Formerly "Tor3/Me1", but simplified by Exxon (Jan09).  Slightly below (0.09 myr) middle of Nanno Zone NN11b (=CN9b) = midway between FADs of nanno N. amplificus and A. primus.
		MFS	7.72	Medium	2/3rds up in Nanno Zone NN11a (CN9a)
	Tor2	SB	9.22	Minor	1/4 up in Nanno Zone NN10 (CN8)
		MFS	10.51	Major	Middle of Sequence Ser 4/Tor 1.  This flooding event is a major short transgression in Late Miocene; and indicated as "major" on long-term trend.
	Tor1	SB	11.8	Major	Formerly "Ser4/Tor1", but simplified by Exxon (Jan09).  0.1 myr above Base of Nanno Zone NN7 (CN5b; FAD D. kugleri -- which aslo coincided with Base of Foram Zone M11 =FAD G. nepenthes in Hardenbol chart; but this foram FAD is now placed 0.2 myr later).  Maximum regression of Middle Miocene trend.  Assigned as major SB for Long-Term trend.

	Ser1	SB	13.82	Major	Base-Serravallian GSSP (2007 ratified) is at Mi-3b cooling event = major Sequence Boundary (Ser 1 = TB2.5 of Haq).  Hardenbol (SEPM'98) had coincident with FAD of foram Fohsella (Globorotalia) peripheroacuta (former "working definition" of base of Serravallian Stage = 14.24 Ma in GTS04 scale).
		MFS	15.2	Major	Middle of Sequence Bur 5/Lan 1.  Maximum transgression of Miocene.  But, ranked as "mediium" on long-term trends.
	Bur5/Lan1	SB	16.38	Medium	FAD of foram Praeorbulina (G.) sicana (= former "working definition of base of Langhian Stage, but but current one is base of Chron C5Br = 15.97 Ma)
		MFS	16.96	Major	Middle of Sequence Bur 4
	Bur4	SB	17.54	Minor	Base Foram Zone N7 (M4) = LAD of foram Catapsydrax dissimilis (and also Globorotalia zealandica & G. semivera)
		MFS	17.83	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 3
	Bur3	SB	18.12	Minor	In Hardenbol'98, an apparent equivalence was just above FAD of foram Globigerinatella insueta (base Foram Zone N6, M3) and mid-way in Nanno Zone CN2 (approx range of S. belemnos), but cycle-scaling of this Foram FAD and the Nanno LAD by Lourens et al (2004) with Atlantic ODP Sites is about 1 myr younger. The middle of Nanno Zone NN3 (midway between LADs of T. carinatus & S. belemnos) is used here; which is still 0.5 myr earlier than the lifted Foram FAD.
		MFS	18.64	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 2
	Bur2	SB	19.17	Minor	There is no major Foram/Nanno zonal marker near this SB.  It is placed just above (0.1 myr) the mid-point of SBs Bur1 and Bur3.  This proportional placement is used here.
		MFS	19.8	Medium	Middle of Sequence Aq 3/Bur 2
	Bur1	SB	20.43	Major	Hardenbol et al (1998) assigned this as Base of Burdigalian Stage, which was placed at the FAD of Foram Globigerinoides altiaperturus by Berggren et al (1995); and has a cycle-calibrated age of 20.06 Ma in Lourens et al (2004).  The GTS2004 Neogene scale by Lourens et al use the FAD of Nanno H. ampliaperta; which is about 0.5 myr earlier; and is approximately at the historical base-Burdigalian.  This Nanno assignment is used here for the SB boundary, which is presumed to delineate the original Burdigalian.
		MFS	20.94	Minor	Middle of Sequence Aq 2
	Aq2	SB	21.44	Minor	FAD of foram Globoquadrina dehiscens forma spinosa
		MFS	22.24	Major	Middle of Sequence Aq 1
	Aq1	SB	23.03	Medium	Base of Miocene (= base of polarity Chron C6Cn.2n; FAD of nannofossil Sphenolithus capricornutus; oxygen isotope event Mi-1).  This base-Miocene is cycle-calibrated in Atlantic ODP Site 926.  SB is culmination of a Late Oligocene regressive trend; but ranked "medium" on long-term.
		MFS	23.96	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ch 3
	Ch3	SB	24.89	Minor	Slightly younger (0.05 myr) than middle of Foram Zone P22
		MFS	26.2	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ch 2
	Ch2	SB	27.5	Minor	Base of Nanno Zone NP25 (CP19a) = LAD of nanno Sphenolithes distentus
		MFS	27.79	Major	Middle of Sequence Ch 1.  This Sequence Ch 1 is a short, but significant oscillation of long-term sea-level.
	Ch1	SB	28.09	Major	Base of Chattian stage (working definition has been LAD of Foram Chiloguembelina (top of Zone P21a); but is diachronous among basins.

Major Mesozoic-Cenozoic T-R Trends (SEPM98)	trend					CENOZOIC-MESOZOIC = Hardenbol, J., Jacquin, T., Vail, P.R., et al. (SEPM charts. 1998)
		SB	0	Major	Today
		MFS	15.2	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 5/Lan 1.  Maximum transgression of Miocene.  But, ranked as "mediium" on long-term trends.
	Ch1	SB	28.09	Major	Base of Chattian stage (working definition has been LAD of Foram Chiloguembelina (top of Zone P21a); but is diachronous among basins.  Therefore, a temporary working definition is base of Chron C10n.1n (28.45 in GTS2004), and LAD of Chiloguembelina is assigned to this Chron boundary.  Major SB in Cenozoic.
		MFS	53.01	Medium	Middle of Sequence Yp 5.  End of Late Paleocene-earliest Eocene trangressive trend.
	Sel1	SB	61.61	Major	Base of Selandian (by definition); which is 33 precession cycles above base of Chron C26r (Concise GTS 61.1Ma used here).  [Pre-Sept'08 = Slightly above (0.2 myr) base of Selandian Stage, or slightly below (0.2 myr) middle of Foram Zone P3a.  The later assignment is used here, because Selandian still lacks a ratified definition.  Culmination of Long-term Regression of latest Cretaceous-Danian.]
		MFS	93.63	Major	Middle of Watinoceras devonense ammonite zone (Tethyan).  Maximum of Cretaceous Transgression.
	Be7	SB	140.75	Major	Middle of upper half of Tirnovella picteti subzone of Berriasella (Fauriella) boissieri ammonite zone (Tethyan).  Culmination of Latest Jurassic-Earliest Cretaceous Regression.
		MFS	153.76	Major	Middle of Aulacostephanus (Pseudomutabilis) eudoxus.  Peak of maximum flooding in Kimm (and in Late Jurassic)
	Aa2	SB	171.29	Major	Base of B. bradfordensis Zone = Peak of regression in Middle and Early Jurassic!
		MFS	180.36	Major	Base of H. bifrons Zone = Peak of major transgression in Middle Jurassic
	No2	SB	213.82	Major	Just above (0.15 myr) the base of Sag. quinquepunctatus s.z.  Peak Regression of Middle-Late Triassic major trend.
		MFS	241.63	Medium	Middle of C. chiesense s.z.  Peak flooding of long-term Early Triassic transgression.  This peak is interpreted as later (one higher MFS = base of T. poseidon Zone) in Boreal realm.
	Chang-3	SB	251.5	Major	From Haq-Schutter (Science, 2008).  65% up in combined Meishensis-Changxingxing.  Perm-Tri boundary is transgressive surface at 251 Ma.

Such a cataclysm could have wiped out mammoths and other large mammals, abruptly ended the Paleo-Indian Clovis culture, and triggered a millennium-long return to near-glacial cold (Younger Dryas interval)." (review by Kerr, 2 Jan 2009, Science 323:26).  Main supporting observations are an anomalous black organic-rich mat with nanodiamonds near the base. "Earth's collision with a rare swarm of carbonaceous chondrites or comets at the onset of the Younger Dryas cool interval, producing multiple airbursts and possible surface impacts, with severe repercussions for plants, animals, and humans in North America." (Kennett et al., 2 Jan 2009, Science 323:94) Diam.(km): shower, maybe small craters

Australia Field centered about N 1ﾡ E 104ﾡ. Age = 803 ﾱ 3 ka (Ar/Ar; Yamei et al., 2000).  Largest tektite field (10% Earth's surface), implying a crater 30-110 km diameter; but none has been located.  Relative densities and Muong Nong-type tektites suggest a crater location in Vietnam or Thailand. Diam.(km): no crater found
	Chesapeake Bay (Virginia, USA)	35.5		For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/chesapeake.html">Chesapeake</a>]. Virginia, U.S.A. N 37ﾡ17' W 76ﾡ1'. Age is 35.5 ﾱ 0.3.  The bolide impacted at a speed of many kilometers per second, punching a deep hole through the sediments and into the granite continental basement rock. The bolide itself was completely vaporised, with the basement rock being fractured to depths of 8 kilometers, and a 'peak ring' being raised around it.  Extensive tektite strewnfield beyond.  The deep crater, 38 km across, is surrounded by a flat-floored terrace-like ring trough with an outer edge of collapsed blocks forming ring faults. The entire circular crater is observed at about 85 km in diameter and 1.3 km deep, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon. Diam.(km): 90

The Popigai crater in Siberia, Russia is tied with Manicouagan Reservoir as the 4th largest impact crater on Earth. A large bolide impact created the 100-kilometer diameter crater at 35.7 ﾱ 0.2 Ma during the late Eocene (Priabonian stage). The shock pressures from the impact instantaneously transformed graphite in the ground into diamonds within a 13.6 kilometer radius of the impact point. Diamonds are usually 0.5 to 2 millimeters in diameter; a few exceptional specimens are 10 millimeters in size. The diamonds not only inherit the tabular shape of the original graphite grains but they additionally preserve the original crystal's delicate striations. Diam.(km): 100

The impact caused some of the largest megatsunamis in Earth's history. A cloud of dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater, as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second. Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry, broiling the Earth's surface and igniting global wildfires; meanwhile, shock waves spawned global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things to survive in. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a dramatic greenhouse effect. Another consequence of the impact is that sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. Diam.(km): 170
	Kara (n. Urals, Russia)	70.3		For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/kara.html">Kara</a>]. Russia N 69ﾡ6' E 64ﾡ9'. Age is 70.3 ﾱ 2.2. The Kara crater lies in the southeastern end of the Yugorsky Peninsula, while the Ust-Kara site lies offshore, 15 km east of the small Kara or Karskaya Guba inlet. It was formerly believed that these two sites were two separate craters and that they formed a twin impact structure from a large-scale meteorite hit in the late cretaceous. However, it seems that the Ust-Kara site does not exist as a separate site. Apparently, the Suevite outcrops of the Ust-Kara impact structure are only a part of the Kara impact structure.

Age of top of Ontong Java Plateau is about 122 Ma.  Ingle and Coffin (2004; see Link) suggest that initiation of the most voluminous large igneous province (LIP) on Earth, at ~ 60 million cubic km, may have been massive decompression melting in the upper mantle (300 km depth or more) from a 20 km-diameter bolide.

Fifth largest impact crater known on earth.  Manicouagan Reservoir lies within the remnant of an ancient eroded impact crater (astrobleme). The crater was formed following the impact of a 5 kilometres (3 miles) diameter asteroid which excavated a crater originally about 100 km (62 mi) wide although erosion and deposition of sediments have since reduced the visible diameter to about 72 km (45 mi).  Mount Babel is interpreted as the central peak of the crater. Diam.(km): 100

Age is 342 ﾱ 15; pre-1977 K-Ar, Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr ages recalculated using the decay constants of Steiger and Jager (1977) Ages in millions of years (Ma) before present. The projectile was probably a stony asteroid, at least two kilometres in diameter, and weighing an estimated 15 billion tonnes. The Mont des ﾃboulements, situated in the exact centre of the crater, is interpreted as the central uplift, a consequence of elastic rebound. The crater is classified as a multi-ringed basin with a central uplift. Diam.(km): 54
	Woodleigh (Shark Bay, W. Aust.)	364		For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/woodleigh.html">Woodleigh</a>]. Western Australia S 26ﾼ3' E 114ﾼ39'. Age is 364 ﾱ 8.  Could be as much as 100 km in diameter, based on extrapolation of central-peak; but contentious. Diam.(km): 40

One of the most ancient of all known terrestrial meteor craters, the 51-km-diameter Siljan crater in Sweden is about 368 Ma. Though it has largely been eroded, four lakes (Siljan, Orsasjﾚn, Skattungen and Oresjﾚn) mark its initial boundaries. Diam.(km): 52
	Middle Ordovician suite	467	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n1/full/ngeo.2007.37">Ordov (Nature08)</a>]. Global shower in Middle to early Late Ordovician . From Schmitz, B., et al. (2008, Nature Geoscience 1: 49-53):  Enhanced cratering and meteor flux coincides with main phase of Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (at about the Arenig-Llanvirn boundar; mid-Darriwilian; about 466 Myr ago).  Chondrule age is 470 ﾱ 6 Ma (Ar-Ar dating on chondrules in Middle Ordov. limestone in Sweden); identical within uncertainties to the age of 467.3 ﾱ1.6 Ma (lower Lenodus variabilis conodont zone) for the beds with fossil meteorites in Sweden and China (GTS04 time scale).  Breakup of a parent L-chrondrite asteroid may have caused this extended shower. Diam.(km): scattered craters
	Acraman (S. Aust.)	590	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/Acraman.html">Acraman</a>]. South Australia S 32ﾼ1' E 135ﾼ27'. Age is ~590. An evolutionary radiation within marine microorganisms (acritarchs) occurs just above the level as the ejecta layer, and some authors believe there may be a connection. The crater is deeply eroded and its original size must be inferred by indirect means. Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to 85-90 km, while other suggest a smaller size, perhaps only 35-40 km, closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centered. The larger size estimate would imply an energy release of 5.2 x 10^6 megatons of TNT. The ejecta contains shocked minerals and small shatter cones, is composed of rock similar in age and composition to that at the crater, and is associated with an iridium anomaly suggesting contamination with extraterrestrial material.  Diam.(km): 90
	Beaverhead (Montana, USA)	900	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/beaverhead.html">Beaverhead</a>]. Montana, U.S.A. N 44ﾡ36' W 113ﾡ0'. Impact is estimated to have occurred about 900 Ma, although its age is only pinned to >600 Ma. The 60-km-diameter Beaverhead Impact Structure is one of only eight known bolide impacts with craters over 50 km in diameter. Scientists now believe that the center of the Beaverhead Impact Crater is in Idaho within the Salmon-Challis National Forest.  It is 60 km in diameter and  Tectonism has broken up regions of the original shocked rocks and dispersed them as large discrete areas across the geological landscape. Diam.(km): 60
	Sudbury (Ontario, Can.)	1850		For details click [<a href="http://www.passc.net/EarthImpactDatabase/sudbury.html">Sudbury</a>]. Ontario, Canada N 46ﾡ36' W 81ﾡ11'. Age is 1850 ﾱ 3. Sudbury Basin may be the second largest crater on Earth, after the 300 km Vredefort crater in South Africa, and larger than the 170 km Chicxulub crater in Yucatﾇn, Mexico.  The current Sudbury Basin i(62 km long, 30 km wide, 15 km deep) is believed to be a smaller portion of a 250 km round crater that the bolide originally created.    It was created by a 10 km meteorite impact, 1.85 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. Debris was scattered over an area of 1.6 million square kilometers and travelled over 800 kilometers away.  Subsequent geological processes have deformed the crater into the current smaller oval shape.  Diam.(km): 250

The asteroid that hit Vredefort is one of the largest to ever impact Earth, estimated at over 10 km (6 miles) wide. It is believed by many that the original size of the impact structure could have been 250 km in diameter, or possibly larger. This makes Vredefort the largest known impact structure on Earth. Diam.(km): 300
