	Quaternary	2.588		The Quaternary, long debated in definition and rank (including an era or sub-era status), was proposed by ICS/INQUA in 2007 (ratified by IUGS in July 2009) to be a period/system with its base at the Gelasian GSSP.  This level is close to the first major continental glaciation and dramatic change in ocean circulation to modern patterns.  It spans the past 2.6 myr according to the International Quaternary Association (INQUA); which implies an older onset than the traditional Pleistocene (1985-2009).

	Tarantian	0.126	dashed	Tarantian is the probable name for this "Lt. Pleistocene" interval.  Spans the last Interglacial and following glacial cycle.

	Ionian	0.781	dashed	Ionian is the probably name for this "M. Pleistocene" interval.

	Calabrian	1.806		Calabrian GSSP is the former Plio-Pleistocene boundary (Vrica)

	Gelasian	2.588		Gelasian stage was transferred to Pleistocene series by IUGS/ICS/INQUA (submitted May 2007; but was not ratified by IUGS until summer 2009 after another round of ICS voting and resubmission).  This enabled formalization of the Quaternary as an official system of the international scale.

	Selandian	61.1		Ratified by ICS/IUGS (Spr'08):  Onset of a carbon isotope shift and sea-level drop (Exxon/Hardenbol sequence boundary "Sel1"); near diversification of the Fasciculith group of calcareous nannoplankton, preceding the lowest Fasciculithus tympaniformis (base of nannoplankton zone NP5).  Approximately 0.65 myr (ca. 33 precession cycles) above the base of magnetic polarity Chron C26r.  [Revised definition is about 0.6 myr younger than GTS04 provisional version (which was base of Chron C26r)]

	Danian	65.5

	Maastrichtian	70.6

	Campanian	83.5

	Santonian	85.8	dashed	85.85 retained as 85.8 in GTS04; GSSP not yet decided

	Coniacian	88.6	dashed	The base of the Coniacian Stage is the lowest occurrence of the Cremnoceramus rotundatus (sensu Tröger non Fiege) inoceramid bivalve.  In GTS04, this inoceramid datum had been considered to be slightly older (suggested by U. Kaplan, in northern Germany) than the lowest occurrence of ammonite Forresteria petrocoriensis, which had a spline-fit age of 89.07 Ma.  Therefore, the base-Coniacian had been estimated as 89.3 Ma.  However, it is now known from inoceramid-ammonite calibration studies that the onset of the F. petrocoriensis zone (or Foresteria peruuana zone) is in late Turonian, and the Coniacian as defined above begins approximately at the base of the overlying Scaphites preventricosus ammonite zone (age of 88.58 Ma in GTS04; which had been used as the Early/Middle Coniacian boundary level !!).  Other than the inoceramid datum and associated base-Coniacian GSSP age, this correction does not alter any of the assigned ages for any other biostratigraphic or other stratigraphic events.   [NOTE: 88.58 rounds off to 88.6]

	Turonian	93.6

	Cenomanian	99.6

	Albian	112.0	dashed

	Aptian	125.0		Current working definition for the base of Aptian Stage is the base of Polarity Chron M0r.

	Barremian	130.0

	Hauterivian	133.9		In GTS04, the base of the Hauterivian Stage has been assigned an age of 136.4 Ma based on the reported occurrence of its earliest ammonites to near the beginning of magnetic polarity chron M11n (Channell et al., 1995, EPSL).  However, the GTS04 authors and reviewers were not aware that this published correlation had been revised.  The base of the Hauterivian is now considered to be near the beginning of chron M10n (e.g., Weissert and others), as supported by later studies (e.g, McArthur et al., 2007, Palaeo-3), and consistent with the cycle-scaled duration of the Valanginian.  Maintaining the same M-sequence age assignments implies that the base of the Hauterivian is approximately 133.9 Ma.

	Valanginian	140.2

	Berriasian	145.5

	Tithonian	150.8

	Norian	216.5	dashed

	Carnian	228.7	dashed	Triassic subcommission has decided to lower the boundary to the base of D. canadensis ammonite zone (base of Daxatina) and of Halobia bivalves; instead of the higher FAD of Trachyceras (which was used in GTS2004).

	Ladinian	237.0		Basal age is probably about 240 Ma based on later U-Pb dates; the 237 Ma age is from Ar-Ar dates.

	Anisian	245.9	dashed	Working group has proposed the profound conodont turnover including lowest occurrences of Chiosella (Cs. Gondolloides).  GTS2004 had used an ammonite placement near the higher FAD of Cs. timorensis.  [NOTE: new U-Pb ages on this level yield an age closer to 249 Ma]

	Olenekian	249.5	dashed	Working group decision (Nov07) is the lowest occurrence of conodont Neospathodus waageni s.l., just above base of Rohillites rohilla ammonite zone.  This is  slightly different than in GTS2004 (FAD of Hedenstroemia or Meekoceras gracilitatis ammonites).  Base-Olenekian age derived by cycle-scaling from base-Triassic (fixed as 251Ma; although new U-Pb ages yield ca. 252.3 Ma for that P/Tr level)

	Induan	251.0		New U-Pb ages yield ca. 252.3 Ma for P/Tr level.

	Gzhelian	303.4		Working group definition is lowest occurrence of Idiognathodus simulator sensu stricto; rather than the Near lowest occurrences of the fusulinids Daixina, Jigulites and Rugosofusulina used in GTS2004.  Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07), relative to base-Permian, which is consistent with U-Pb dating by Mark Schmitz (presented at Nanjing Perm-Carb congress, June 07)

	Kasimovian	307.2		The current preferred definition by working group is the base of the Protriticites pseudomontiparus-Obsoletes obsoletus conodont zone (equals base of Swadelina neoshoensis zone) .  GTS04 had used base of Obsoletes obsoletes and Protriticites pseudomontiparus fusulinid zone.   Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07) = MFS of Farlington cycle (Lower Suvorova) relative to base-Permian.

	Moscovian	311.7	dashed

	Bashkirian	318.1

	Serpukhovian	328.3	dashed	In GTS04, the base of the Serpukhovian Stage had been assigned an age of 326 Ma based on a tentative working definition of the first appearance of the conodont Lochriea cruciformis.  The boundary working group decided that the first evolutionary appearance of the conodont Lochriea ziegleri in the lineage Lochriea nodosa - Lochriea ziegleri presents the best potential for an international definition of the boundary.

Assignment of 499 by Peng and Babcock in Concise GTS has similar logic, but is partly based on the Paibian being 8 zones higher in that Australian zonation (not 6) and partly on later ages.

GSSPs	event	80	UNESCO-Named			The current status of currently ratified GSSPs and possible markers for the other geologic units are summarized at ICS Subcommission for Stratigraphic Information [Click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/">GSSP</a> ].  The base of each unit of the geologic time scale is defined at a specific location and point (Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point, GSSP), where it coincides with an array of paleontological, geochemical, paleomagnetic or other markers for high-resolution global correlation.  

EVENT

	GSSP	0.0117		Holocene GSSP (ratified 2008)  [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=5&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics]  is the end of the Younger Dryas cold spell, which is reflected in a shift in deuterium excess values; with the GSSP at 1492.45m depth in Borehole NGRIP2 in Greenland.

	GSSP	0.126	dashed	Upper Pleistocene subseries GSSP coincides with the base of the Eemian interglacial stage (= base of marine isotope stage 5e) before final glacial episode of Pleistocene.  Approved by ICS in 2008; but IUGS didn't approve and requested clarification of "auxiliary" sections and correlations.

	GSSP	1.806		The base of the Calabrian Stage of the Pleistocene Series [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=9&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined as the base of the marine claystones conformably overlying the sapropelic Marker Bed "e" in the Vrica Section, Italy.  However, the base-Pleistocene was proposed in 2007 by ICS/INQUA (and ratified by IUGS in July 2009) to be lowered to include the Gelasian Stage (see next GSSP).

	GSSP	2.588		The base of the Gelasian Stage, base of the Quaternary System/Period and associated base of Pleistocene (as proposed in 2007 by IUGS/ICS/INQUA; ratified by IUGS in 2009) [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=10&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined as the base of the marly layer overlying sapropel MPRS 250, located at 62m in Monte San Nicola section, Italy.  This is just after the first major continental episode (the traditional Ice Age onset of North Hemisphere).  The astronomical age of sapropel MPRS 250 (mid-point), corresponding to precessional cycle 250 from the present, is 2.588 Ma, which can be assumed as the age of the boundary.

	GSSP	3.6		The base of the Piacenzian Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=13&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined as the base of the beige marl bed of the small-scale carbonate cycle 77. It corresponds to precessional excursion 347 as numbered from the present, with an astrochronological age estimate of 3.600 Ma. The GSSP is located in the Punta Piccola section, Italy.

	GSSP	5.333		The base of the Pliocene Series and the Zanclean Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=14&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined as the base of the Trubi Formation. The age of the Zanclean and Pliocene GSSP at the base of the stage is 5.33 Ma in the orbitally calibrated time scale, and lies within the lowermost reversed episode of the Gilbert Chron (C3n.4r), below the Thvera normal subchron.

	GSSP	7.246		The base of the Messinian stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=16&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined at the base of the reddish layer of sedimentary cycle no. 15 at Oued Akrech, Morocco, NW Africa. This point coincides closely with the first regular occurrence of the planktonic foraminifer Globorotalia miotumida and the first occurrence of the calcareous nannofossil Amaurolithus delicatus, and falls within the interval of reversed polarity that corresponds to C3Br.1r. The base of the reddish layer and, thus, the Messinian GSSP has been assigned an astronomical age of 7.251Ma (later revised to 7.246).

	GSSP	11.608		The base of the Tortonian Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=17&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined as the mid-point of the sapropel layer of basic cycle number 76 in the Monte dei Corvi Beach section, located on the Adriatic coast of central Italy, 5km SE of Ancona. This level has been assigned an astronomical age of 11.608 Ma. It coincides almost exactly with the Last Common Occurrences of the calcareous nannofossil Discoaster kugleri and the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides subquadratus, and is associated with the short normal-polarity subchron C5r.2n. This level coincides closely with oxygen isotope event Mi-5 and the associated glacio-eustatic sea-level low-stand of supercycle T3.1 and concurrent deep-sea hiatus NH4.

	GSSP	13.82		Serravallian GSSP (ratified Fall 2006) coincides with Mi3b oxygen-isotopic event (global cooling episode and sequence boundary) within magnetic polarity chronozone C5ACn, and is below the lowest occurrence of nannofossil Sphenolithus heteromorphus.

	GSSP	23.03		The base of the Neogene System, Miocene Series and Aquitanian Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=21&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined in the Lemme-Carrosio Section (35m from the top of the section) in the village of Carrosio, south of the town of Gavi and north of Voltaggio (Allessandria Province), Italy.

	GSSP	33.9		The base of the Oligocene Series and Rupelian Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=25&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined in the Massignano section about 10km southeast of Ancona, Italy. The GSSP is at the base of a 0.5m thick greenish-grey marl bed. At this level, both the planktonic foraminifera Hantkenina and Cribrohantkenina, Eocene genera of the Hantkeninidae, become extinct.

	GSSP	55.8		The base of the Eocene Series and Ypresian Stage [click  <a href="http://stratigraphy.science.purdue.edu/gssp/detail.php?periodid=30&top_parentid=2">GSSP</a>  for graphics] is defined in the DBH subsection of the Dababiya Section, near Luxor, Egypt, at the base of a lithostratigraphic unit where the initiation of a major Carbon-Isotope Excursion (CIE) is recorded.

	GSSP	58.74		The Thanetian GSSP coincides with base of magnetic polarity Chron C26n at Zumaia section, northern Spain.

	GSSP	61.1		The Selandian GSSP of a carbon isotope shift and sea-level drop (Exxon/Hardenbol sequence boundary "Sel1"); near diversification of the Fasciculith group of calcareous nannoplankton, preceding the lowest Fasciculithus tympaniformis (base of nannoplankton zone NP5).  Approximately 0.65 myr (ca. 33 precession cycles) above the base of magnetic polarity Chron C26r.  [Revised definition is about 0.6 myr younger than GTS04 provisional version (which was base of Chron C26r)]

Base-Olenekian age derived by cycle-scaling from base-Triassic (fixed as 251Ma; although new U-Pb ages yield ca. 252.3 Ma for that P/Tr level)

	*__*	275.6	dashed	Potential Kungurian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Neostreptognathus pnevi-N. exculptus.

	*__*	284.4	dashed	Potential Artinskian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Sweetognathus whitei.

	*__*	294.6	dashed	Potential Sakmarian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of conodont Sweetognathus merrelli.

	*__*	303.4	dashed	Working group definition is lowest occurrence of Idiognathodus simulator sensu stricto; rather than the Near lowest occurrences of the fusulinids Daixina, Jigulites and Rugosofusulina used in GTS2004.  Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07), relative to base-Permian, which is consistent with U-Pb dating by Mark Schmitz (presented at Nanjing Perm-Carb congress, June 07).

	*__*	307.2	dashed	The current preferred definition by working group is the base of the Protriticites pseudomontiparus-Obsoletes obsoletus conodont zone (equals base of Swadelina neoshoensis zone) .  GTS04 had used base of Obsoletes obsoletes and Protriticites pseudomontiparus fusulinid zone.   Estimate is based on cycle-strat (Heckel, pers. commun., Dec07) = MFS of Farlington cycle (Lower Suvorova) relative to base-Permian.

	*__*	311.7	dashed	Potential Moscovian GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrences of conodonts Declinognathodus donetzianus and/or Idiognathoides postsulcatus, and of fusulinid Aljutovella aljutovica.

	*__*	328.3	dashed	In GTS04, the base of the Serpukhovian Stage had been assigned an age of 326 Ma based on a tentative working definition of the first appearance of the conodont Lochriea cruciformis.  The boundary working group decided that the first evolutionary appearance of the conodont Lochriea ziegleri in the lineage Lochriea nodosa - Lochriea ziegleri presents the best potential for an international definition of the boundary.

	*__*	489.5	dotted	Potential substage of TENTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of Codylodus adesei conodont.

	*__*	492	dashed	Potential TENTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Lotagnostus americanus.

	*__*	496	dashed	Potential NINTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Agnostotes orientalis.

	*__*	510	dashed	Potential FIFTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Oryctocephalus indicus.

	*__*	515	dotted	Potential FOURTH Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of trilobite Olenellus or Redlichia.

	*__*	521	dashed	Potential THIRD Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of Trilobites.

	*__*	528	dotted	Potential SECOND Cambrian Stage (yet to be named) GSSP may coincide with lowest occurrence of Small Shelly Fossils, or Archaeocyathid species.

Newark basin (eastern USA) with cycle scaling	Primary

	N	Basalt	201.300		Basalt overlying Newark lake beds is N polarity (and had been assumed to be 202 Ma).  However, U-Pb by Schoene et al on coeval Orange Mtn now yield 201.3 Ma.   Basalt N shown as arbitrary 0.4 myr duration.

	U	Gap?	202.00		Gallet-Krystyn et al suggest a mid-Rhaetian GAP here, which [in GTS07] will be arbitrary assigned as 0.7 Ma -- to allow underlying Newark to keep same ages as Kent-Olsen.

Sequences (SEPM Global or Tethyan; Haq and Schutter, 2008)	sequence					Ceno-Mesozoic = Hardenbol, J., Jacquin, T., Vail, P.R., et al. (SEPM charts, 1998), Paleozoic = Haq and Schutter (Science, 2008) with Seq-stage-nomenclature by ExxonMobil group (Chengjie Liu et al., Jan'08, who also modified some of the previous SEPM nomenclature for Ceno-Mesozoic)

		MFS	0.00	Major	A major transgression-MFS is indicated for Today, which presumes continued melting of glaciers will exceed the Eemian previous maximum highstand.

	LGM	SB	0.02	Major	Last Glacial Maximum; Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2

		MSF	0.13	Major	Base of Eemian stage; MIS 5

	MIS6	SB	0.14	Major	Peak of Illinoian/Saalian glacial; MIS 6

		MFS	0.24	Medium	Onset of main pulse of interglacial MIS 7 MSF after glacial MIS 8

	MIS8	SB	0.27	Medium	Glacial MIS 8.

		MFS	0.42	Medium	Interglacial MIS 11 MSF after glacial MIS 10

	MIS12	SB	0.44	Major	Glacial MIS 12 (approx.) = major peak.  Glacial MIS 10 and 14 are lesser shifts than MIS 12 or MIS 16, therefore are omitted here.

		MFS	0.62	Medium	Onset of major interglacial MIS 15 MSF after glacial MIS 16

	MIS16	SB	0.64	Major	Glacial MIS 16 (approx.).  Glacial MIS 18 on isotope curve is lesser than either M22 or M16; therefore omitted here.

		MFS	0.84	Medium	Est. interglacial MSF after glacial MIS 22

	MIS22	SB	0.86	Major	Glacial MIS 22.  Oldest major peak on O-18 curve.  Just below base of Brunhes Normal.  Was called "Oi 1" on SEPM chart, but Pleistocene subcomm doesn't recommend an "Ionian" stage for global use.

		MFS	0.95	Minor	SEPM chart has at approximate mid-point of Sequence "Cala 2".  This seems rather arbitrary, because a full suite of glacial/interglacial oscillations are underway; and a re-assignment to the mor pronounced interglacial MIS 25 (0.95 Ma; just above base of Jaramillo normal-polarity chron), which as a relatively higher "peak" suggesting increased highstand, is used here.  This also corresponds to base of Italian "Ionian Stage".

	MIS 52 (Cala2)	SB	1.54	Medium	SEPM chart shows as slightly below (0.15 myr) Middle of Foram Zone N22a.  Uncertain re-calibration to marine isotope stages; but might be glacial MIS 52 (1.54 Ma), which has a slightly higher magnitude than adjacent peaks.

		MFS	1.64	Medium	SEPM chart places this MFS at about 0.05 myr above Cala 1 SB.   Uncertain re-calibration to marine isotope stages; but might be interglacial MIS 55-57 (~1.64-1.59 Ma) as appearing to be a more extended inter-glacial lowstand.  This also corresponds to approximate base of "Emilian substage" of Italian "Calabrian stage".

	MIS 58 (Cala1)	SB	1.65	Medium	SEPM chart seems to place as an arbitrarily 0.16 myr older than Cala 2 SB.  Assigned here as glacial MIS 58, which has a relatively greater "negative" shift, suggesting a more pronounced lowstand.

		MFS	1.76	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 0.05 myr below Cala 1 SB.  Assigned here to interglacial MIS 63, a more pronounced peak at end of Olduvai normal-polarity zone, which is aobut 0.1 myr older than major glacial MIS 58.

	Ge2	SB	2.16	Medium	SEPM chart places as slightly above (0.13 myr) Middle of Nanno Zone NN18 or CN12d.  This is close to major glacial MIS 82 (2.16 Ma), which is used here.

		MFS	2.39	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 3/4ths from base of Ge 1 sequence.  Assigned here as interglacial MIS 89, which is the oldest of a set of relatively pronounced interglacials (and implied highstands).

	Ge1	SB	2.50	Medium	Base Nanno Zone NN17 or CN12c  (LAD of nanno Discoaster surculus).  This corresponds closely to major glacial  MIS 100, and this assignment is used here.

		MFS	2.59	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 0.05 myr below Ge 1 SB.    Re-assigned here as interglacial MIS 103, a major and relatively extended interglacial (and implied lowstand) which defines base of Gelasian stage.  [NOTE:  The glacial MIS 110 (about 0.15 myr before MIS 103) is also a major lowstand, which could be inserted as an additional Sequence below this MFS].

	Pia2	SB	2.80	Medium	Base Nanno Zone CN12b (LAD of nanno Discoaster tamalis).  Corresponds to glacial MIS 114.   Termination of Pliocene transgressive trend (due to onset of major glacials).

		MFS	2.92	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 3/4ths from base of Pia 1 sequence.  Marine isotope curve suggests this is a very broad highstand, and spans most of "Sequence Pia 1".  This highstand is termination of Pliocene transgressive trend; which is a "Medium" MSF on long-term trend.

	Pia1	SB	3.27	Medium	Slightly below (0.05 myr) Middle of Nanno Zone CN12a (=NN16a).  Corresponds to MIS "M2", which is the middle of subchron C2An.2r (Mammoth Reversed chron) in Italian cycle-strat section.

		MFS	3.82	Medium	Hardenbol's SEPM chart displays as only 0.03 above ZA 2 SB (nearly coincident with SB).  However, causes distortion with display => shifted to 25% up in SB.

	Za2	SB	4.01	Medium	SEPM chart displays as just below base of Nanno zone CN11 (=NN15 =LAD D. tricorniculatus).  Recalibration of this Nanno event to cycles places age significantly older (by 0.5 myr).  This correlation via Nannos could be a SB corresponding to Marine Isotope event N2 or N4, with ages of about 4.6 Ma.  Allternataively, the SB corresponds to event Gi16 at about 30% up in Chron C2Ar (middle of Nanno zone CN11b; at 4.0 Ma -- used here).  Need better information on primary calibration of this sequence boundary.

		MFS	4.16	Medium	Arbitrarily drawn as 3/4ths from base of Za 1 sequence

	Za1	SB	4.62	Minor	SEPM chart could be interpreted as placement in Middle of Foram Zone PL1b; but revised correlation of Nanno zone CN11 would make same the higher Za 2 SB.  Therefore, a calibration relative to Nannos is used here:  4/5ths up in CN10c.  Perhaps the primary calibration is Marine Isotope event S16 or S14 (near middle of Nanno Zone 10c; 4.9 Ma)?

		MFS	5.47	Major	Middle of Nanno Zone CN10a

	Me2	SB	5.77	Major	Middle of Nanno Zone NN11d (CN9d) = midway between LAD of nanno Discoaster quinqueramus and LAD of Amaurolithus amplificus.  This lowstand is minimum of Late Miocene regression; which is a "medium" SB on long-term scale.

		MFS	5.99	Medium	Just below (0.05 myr) Top of Nanno zone NN11c (top of CN9c = LAD N. amplificus).

	Me1	SB	7.26	Minor	Slightly below (0.09 myr) middle of Nanno Zone NN11b (=CN9b) = midway between FADs of nanno N. amplificus and A. primus.

		MFS	7.72	Medium	2/3rds up in Nanno Zone NN11a (CN9a)

	Tor2	SB	9.22	Minor	1/4 up in Nanno Zone NN10 (CN8)

		MFS	10.51	Major	Middle of Sequence Ser 4/Tor 1.  This flooding event is a major short transgression in Late Miocene; and indicated as "major" on long-term trend.

	Tor1	SB	11.80	Major	0.1 myr above Base of Nanno Zone NN7 (CN5b; FAD D. kugleri -- which aslo coincided with Base of Foram Zone M11 =FAD G. nepenthes in Hardenbol chart; but this foram FAD is now placed 0.2 myr later).  Maximum regression of Middle Miocene trend.  Assigned as major SB for Long-Term trend.

		MFS	12.26	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ser 3

	Ser3	SB	12.72	Minor	Middle of Nanno Zone NN6 (CN5a)

		MFS	13.12	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ser 2

	Ser2	SB	13.53	Minor	Base of Nanno Zone NN6 (CN5a) LAD of Sphenolithus heteromorphus

		MFS	13.68	Medium	Middle of Sequence Ser 1

	Ser1	SB	13.82	Major	Base-Serravallian GSSP (2007 ratified) is at Mi-3b cooling event = major Sequence Boundary (Ser 1 = TB2.5 of Haq).  Hardenbol (SEPM'98) had coincident with FAD of foram Fohsella (Globorotalia) peripheroacuta (former "working definition" of base of Serravallian Stage = 14.24 Ma in GTS04 scale).

		MFS	15.50	Major	Middle of Sequence Bur 5/Lan 1.  Maximum transgression of Miocene.  But, ranked as "mediium" on long-term trends.

	Bur5/Lan1	SB	16.97	Medium	FAD of foram Praeorbulina (G.) sicana (= former "working definition of base of Langhian Stage, but but current one is base of Chron C5Br = 15.97 Ma)

		MFS	17.26	Major	Middle of Sequence Bur 4

	Bur4	SB	17.54	Minor	Base Foram Zone N7 (M4) = LAD of foram Catapsydrax dissimilis (and also Globorotalia zealandica & G. semivera)

		MFS	17.83	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 3

	Bur3	SB	18.12	Minor	In Hardenbol'98, an apparent equivalence was just above FAD of foram Globigerinatella insueta (base Foram Zone N6, M3) and mid-way in Nanno Zone CN2 (approx range of S. belemnos), but cycle-scaling of this Foram FAD and the Nanno LAD by Lourens et al (2004) with Atlantic ODP Sites is about 1 myr younger. The middle of Nanno Zone NN3 (midway between LADs of T. carinatus & S. belemnos) is used here; which is still 0.5 myr earlier than the lifted Foram FAD.

		MFS	18.64	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 2

	Bur2	SB	19.17	Minor	There is no major Foram/Nanno zonal marker near this SB.  It is placed just above (0.1 myr) the mid-point of SBs Bur1 and Bur3.  This proportional placement is used here.

		MFS	19.80	Medium	Middle of Sequence Aq 3/Bur 2

	Bur1	SB	20.43	Major	Hardenbol et al (1998) assigned this as Base of Burdigalian Stage, which was placed at the FAD of Foram Globigerinoides altiaperturus by Berggren et al (1995); and has a cycle-calibrated age of 20.06 Ma in Lourens et al (2004).  The GTS2004 Neogene scale by Lourens et al use the FAD of Nanno H. ampliaperta; which is about 0.5 myr earlier; and is approximately at the historical base-Burdigalian.  This Nanno assignment is used here for the SB boundary, which is presumed to delineate the original Burdigalian.

		MFS	20.94	Minor	Middle of Sequence Aq 2

	Aq2	SB	21.44	Minor	FAD of foram Globoquadrina dehiscens forma spinosa

		MFS	22.24	Major	Middle of Sequence Aq 1

	Aq1	SB	23.03	Medium	Base of Miocene (= base of polarity Chron C6Cn.2n; FAD of nannofossil Sphenolithus capricornutus; oxygen isotope event Mi-1).  This base-Miocene is cycle-calibrated in Atlantic ODP Site 926.  SB is culmination of a Late Oligocene regressive trend; but ranked "medium" on long-term.

		MFS	23.94	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ch 3

	Ch3	SB	24.84	Minor	Slightly younger (0.05 myr) than middle of Foram Zone P22

		MFS	26.17	Minor	Middle of Sequence Ch 2

	Ch2	SB	27.50	Minor	Base of Nanno Zone NP25 (CP19a) = LAD of nanno Sphenolithes distentus

		MFS	27.97	Major	Middle of Sequence Ch 1.  This Sequence Ch 1 is a short, but significant oscillation of long-term sea-level.

	Ch1	SB	28.45	Major	Base of Chattian stage (working definition has been LAD of Foram Chiloguembelina (top of Zone P21a); but is diachronous among basins.  Therefore, a temporary working definition is base of Chron C10n.1n (28.45 in GTS2004), and LAD of Chiloguembelina is assigned to this Chron boundary.  Major SB in Cenozoic.

		MFS	28.95	Major	Middle of Sequence Ru 3

	Ru3	SB	29.45	Minor	FAD of foram Globigerina angulisuturalis

		MFS	30.72	Major	Slightly above (0.1 myr) middle of Sequence RU3; as is drawn by Hardenbol et al. 1998.  Culmination of long-term transgression of Late Eocene-Early Oligocene

	Ru2	SB	32.19	Minor	Base of foram P19 zone (LAD of Pseudohastigerina sp.)

		MFS	32.61	Medium	Arbitrarily 0.1 myr below LAD of nanno Reticulofenestra umbilicus (low-mid latitude)/R. hillae

	Ru1	SB	33.88	Medium	Base of Oligocene (LAD of Hankenina in Medit.)

		MFS	34.32	Minor	Middle of Sequence Pr 3

	Pr3	SB	34.76	Minor	Just below (0.05 myr) the middle of Foram Zone P16

		MFS	34.96	Minor	Middle of Sequence Pr 2

	Pr2	SB	35.17	Minor	Base Nanno Zone NP19 (CP15b) = FAD I. recurvus (but, as re-calibrated by ODP Leg 145, this event is ~1myr younger than in Berggren et al. 1995)

		MFS	36.20	Medium	Middle of Sequence Pr 1

	Pr1	SB	37.2	Major	Base of Late Eocene (not defined, but working definition in Berggren et al was base of Nanno Zone NP18 = FAD C. oamaruensis; whereas GTS2004 used base Chron C17n.1n).  GTS2004 working definition used here, but neither might match actual SB level.  Assigned here as base of Priabonian for now.

		MFS	37.89	Minor	Middle of Sequence Bart 1

	Bart1	SB	38.54	Minor	Arbitrarily 0.1 myr above midpoint between LADs of foram Acarinina primitiva and Subbotina frontosa

		MSF	0.00	Major	A major transgression-MFS is indicated for Today, which presumes continued melting of glaciers will exceed the Eemian previous maximum highstand.

	LGM	SB	0.02	Major	Last Glacial Maximum; Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2

		MFS	2.92	Medium	SEPM chart displays as 3/4ths from base of Pia 1 sequence.  Marine isotope curve suggests this is a very broad highstand, and spans most of "Sequence Pia 1".  This highstand is termination of Pliocene transgressive trend; which is a "Medium" MSF on long-term trend.

	Me2	SB	5.77	Medium	Middle of Nanno Zone NN11d (CN9d) = midway between LAD of nanno Discoaster quinqueramus and LAD of Amaurolithus amplificus.  This lowstand is minimum of Late Miocene regression; which is a "medium" SB on long-term scale.

		MFS	10.51	Major	Middle of Sequence Ser 4/Tor 1.  This flooding event is a major short transgression in Late Miocene; and indicated as "major" on long-term trend.

	Tor1	SB	11.80	Major	0.1 myr above Base of Nanno Zone NN7 (CN5b; FAD D. kugleri -- which aslo coincided with Base of Foram Zone M11 =FAD G. nepenthes in Hardenbol chart; but this foram FAD is now placed 0.2 myr later).  Maximum regression of Middle Miocene trend.  Assigned as major SB for Long-Term trend.

		MSF	15.71	Medium	Middle of Sequence Bur 5/Lan 1.  Maximum transgression of Miocene.  But, ranked as "mediium" on long-term trends.

	Aq 1	SB	23.03	Medium	"Base of Miocene (= base of polarity Chron C6Cn.2n; FAD of nannofossil Sphenolithus capricornutus; oxygen isotope event Mi-1).  This base-Miocene is cycle-calibrated in Atlantic ODP Site 926.  SB is culmination of a Late Oligocene regressive trend; but ranked "medium" on long-term."

		MSF	27.97	Major	Middle of Sequence Ch 1.  This Sequence Ch 1 is a short, but significant oscillation of long-term sea-level.

	Ch1	SB	28.45	Major	Base of Chattian stage (working definition has been LAD of Foram Chiloguembelina (top of Zone P21a); but is diachronous among basins.  Therefore, a temporary working definition is base of Chron C10n.1n (28.45 in GTS2004), and LAD of Chiloguembelina is assigned to this Chron boundary.  Major SB in Cenozoic.

		MSF	58.78	Medium	Middle of Sequence Th 1 (approx.Top of Selandian stage working definition).  End of Selandian transgressive trend.

	Sel1	SB	61.45	Major	Slightly above (0.2 myr) base of Selandian Stage, or slightly below (0.2 myr) middle of Foram Zone P3a.  The later assignment is used here, because Selandian still lacks a ratified definition.  Culmination of Long-term Regression of latest Cretaceous-Danian.

		MSF	69.46	Medium	Middle of Sequence Ma2.  Magnitude of MFS uncertain.

	Ma1	SB	70.56	Medium	Base of Baculites baculus ammonite zone (but could be as high as middle of zone ~0.25myr higher)

	TOCE	489.02		Top Of Cambrian carbon isotope Excursion (TOC-E) = large negative-excursion near end of Cambrian.  Base of Ordovician is marked by return to near-zero delta-C13 values.

	SPICE	499.00		Steptoean Positive Isotope-Carbon Excursion (S-PICE) begins with mass extinction at top of Marjumiid biomere (base of Pterocephaliid biomere) in USA (= Marjuman/Steptoean stage boundary).  Documented by Saltzman et al (2000, Palaeo-3, 162, p211-223).

	DICE	507.46		Drumian Isotope-Carbon Excursion (D-ICE) = negative maximum that nearly coincides with beginning of Drumian stage (although it is mainly end of Stage 5).  FAD of Ptychagnostus atavus, the agnostoid trilobite that is the marker for basal Drumian, occurs in lower part of eustatic rise associated with maximum of DICE.

	ROECE	510.60		Redlichiid and Olenellid trilobites Extinction Carbon isotope Excursion (ROE-CE) = large negative excursion near Stage 4/5 boundary that seems coeval with extinction of redlichiid trilobites in Gondwana and olenellid trilobites in Laurentia.

	AECE	513.38		Archaeocyathid Extinction Carbon isotope Excursion (AE-CE) = significant negative excursion in mid-Stage 4.

	MICE	516.62		MIngxinsi Carbon isotope Excursion (MI-CE), named after Mingxinsi Formation (Guizhou, China) = large positive excursion in lower Stage 4.  A major archaeocyathid radiation is associated, plus Laggerstaetten of Sinsk Formation (Siberia) and Kinzers Formation (Pennsylvania, USA).

	CARE	521.00		Cambrian Arthropod Radiation isotope Excursion (CAR-E) = large positive-excursion near base of Stage 3.  Associated with appearance of wide variety of arthropods (Lagerstaetten deposits such as Chengjiang in Yunnan and Sirius Passet in north Greenland).

	SHICE	525.06		SHIyantou Carbon istoope Excursion (SHI-CE), named after Shiyantou Formation (eastern Yunnan, China) = large negative-excursion immediately following ZHU-CE in mid-Stage 2.   Coeval with extinction of many Small Shelly Fossil organisms. 

	ZHUICE	529.40		ZHUjianqing Carbon isotope Excursion (ZHU-CE), named after the basal Cambrian Zhujianqing Formation (eastern Yunnan, China) = large positive-excursion in lower Stage 2, and corresponds to third major assemblage of Small Shelly Fossils (SSFs) on the Yangtze Platform.

	BACE	542.00		BAsal Cambrian Carbon isotope Excursion (BA-CE) = large negative-excursion.  Extinction of acritarchs and most Edicaran-grade organisms is associated with a strong shift from positive C-13 toward negative values in uppermost Ediacaran.

	N18/N19	5.72		Pliocene Foram Zone PL1 is Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent Range Zone = FAD G. tumida to LAD G. nepenthes (Berggren et al., 1995), with 2 subzones.  History of zone and regional events are summarized in Berggren et al. (1995).  Miocene/Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl1a" is the 'Globorotalia tumida/Globorotalia cibaoensis Concurrent Range SubZone' (FAD of Globorotalia tumida to LAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N18' (or 'N19', which now begins BEFORE 'N18') of Blow (1979).  Lourens et al (GTS2004) also place base of "M14" at this level, but Berggren used an earlier event.  There is no major Foram datum to mark the base of the Pliocene.

	N17b	6.58

This is a very brief interval the global compilation of datums.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; ref [b] which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6, but table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis".

	N4	22.96	

	N3, P22	26.83		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P22' (and 'N3') is defined as the 'Globigerina ciperoensis Partial Range Subzone' (LAD of Parabloborotalia opima opima to FAD of Globorotalia kugleri) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.

	N2, P21	29.45		Oligocene Foram Zone P21 is the Globigerina angulisuturalis/Paragloborotalia opima opima Concurrent Range Zone (Blow, 1969; Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD to LAD, and is subdivided into 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P21a' (= Zone O4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is defined as the 'Globigerina angulisuturalis / Chiloguembelina cubensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of G. angul. to LAD of Chil. cubensis) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).

	N1, P20	30.42		Oligocene Foram Zone "P20" (= Zone O3 of Berggren-Pearson '05) (and "N1") is defined as the 'Globigerina sellii Partial Range Zone' (LAD of '"T." ampliaperatura' to FAD of 'Globigerina angulisuturalis') by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.

	P19	32.19		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P19' (= Zone O2 of Berggren-Pearson '04) is defined as the "'Turborotalia' ampliapertura Interval Zone' (LAD of Pseudohastigerina spp. to LAD of 'T.' ampliapertura) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  "The historical vicissitudes associated with this zone" are discussed in Berggren & MIller (1988). 

	P18	34.00		Eocene Foram Zone P18 = Turborotalia cerroazulensis-Pseudohastigerina spp. Interval Zone (LAD to LAD) (Berggren et al., 1995). Berggren and Miller (1988) used the HO of 'T. ceroazulensis' (rather than that of 'Hantkenina') to denote the P17/18 boundary because of its greater potential for preservation.  The base is defined by Berggren & Miller (1988) as LAD Turbo. cerroazulensis; rather than LAD Hankenina -- but these are nearly synchronous events.  This zone has undergone numerous changes in definitions (briefly reviewed in Berggren et al., 1995).

	P17	34.16		Eocene Foram Zone P17 is the 'Turborotalia cerroazulensis Interval Zone' (LAD of C. inflata to LAD of T. cerroazulensis) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is a very brief zone (~0.2 m.y.); and was no longer used by Berggren-Pearson '05 zonation.

	P16	35.26		Eocene Foram Zone P16 is the 'Turborotalia cunialensis/Cribrohantkenina inflata Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Turbo. cunialensis to LAD of Crib. inflata) (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995).  Previously, the base was FAD of Crib. inflata; but Berggren et al. changed to the more common and better calibrated Turbo. cunialensis.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) discontinued this P16 Zone and zonal marker due to high diachroneity.

	P15	38.03		Eocene Foram Zone P15 is the 'Porticulasphaera semiinvoluta Interval Zone' (FAD of P. semiinvoluta to FAD of Turborotalia cunialensis) (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995).  Previously, the top of zone was FAD of Crib. inflata (e.g., Blow, 1979), which is less common and poorly calibrated.

	P14	39.36		Eocene Foram Zone P14 (nearly same as E13 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Truncorotaloides rohri -Morozovella spinulosa Partial Range Zone' (LAD of G. beckmanni to FAD of P. semiinvoluta) (Berggren and Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.

	P13	39.80		Eocene Foram Zone P13 (= Zone E12) of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Globigerapsis beckmanni Total Range Zone' (FAD to LAD) (Bolli, 1957; Berggren et al., 1995).

	P12	42.60		Eocene Foram Zone P12 is the 'Morozovella lehneri Partial Range Zone' (LAD of M. aragonensis to FAD of G. beckmanni) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.

	P11	45.00		Eocene Foram Zone P11 (= Zone E9 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Globigerapsis kugleri/Morzovella aragonensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD to LAD) (Berggren, 1969, but with complicated history; see redefinition in Berggren et al., 1995).

	P10	48.60		Eocene Foram Zone P10 (= essentially E8 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to the FAD of 'Globigerapsis kugleri') (Berggren & Miller, 1988; = Hankenina aragonensis Zone of Bolli, 1957).

	P9	50.30		Eocene Foram Zone P9 (= E7 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Planorotalites palmerae -Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to FAD) (Berggren et al., 1995).

	P8	50.77		Eocene Foram Zone P8 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella aragonensis Partial Range Zone = 'gap' between LAD of Moro. formosa formosa to FAD of Planorotalites palmerae (Berggren & Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  However, Aubrey et al. (1988, with Berggren as a co-author), places base of P8 at "FAD of Acarinina pentacamerata", and draws this boundary "approximately midway between the boundaries of Zones P6/P7 and P8/P9" (p. 735).  The simultaneous publication of conflicting definitions for base of Zone P8 (both with Berggren as an author, and neither discussing the change) is confusing.

	P7	52.57		Eocene Foram Zone P7 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the 'Morozovella aragonensis/Morozovella formosa formosa Concurrent Range Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. formosa formosa.

	P6b	54.52		Subzone "P6b" of Berggren (1995) scale (= Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is same as "P6c" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella formosa formosa/Morozovella lensiformis -Morozovella aragonensis Interval SubZone"; and from simultaneous FAD of Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Moro. lensiformis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.

	P6a	55.09		Eocene Foram Zone P6 is the Morozovella subbotinae Partial Range Zone (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995) = "gap" from LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.  The P5/6a boundary was used in some publications to approx. Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  Near-basal Eocene Foram SubZone "P6a" of new Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6b" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella velascoensis -Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Morozovella lensiformis Interval SubZone".  Note that this is a "gap" zone between LAD of 'M. velasoensis' and FAD of 'M. formosa formosa/lensiformis'.

	P5	56.67		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P5', as defined by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM) is the 'Morozovella velascoensis Interval Zone' = LAD of Glob. pseudomenardii to LAD of Moro. velascoensis.  This definition of P5 encompasses the former P5 and P6a zones of Berggren and Miller (1988).

	P4	60.19		Paleocene Foram Zone P4 is the Globanomalina pseudomenardii Total Range Zone  (Bolli, 1957a).  Three subzones are defined by Berggren et al. (1995).  Subzone 'P4a' is defined as the 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii / Acarinina subsphaerica Concurrent Range Zone' by Berggren et al. (1995) = FAD G. pseudomenardii to LAD of A. subsphaerica.  Either Glob. pseudomenardii or  Acar. subsphaerica defines P4a base.

	P3	61.72		Paleocene Foram Zone  P3  is the Morozovella angulata-Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone = FAD of P. angulata to FAD of G. pseudomenardii (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of P3 of Berggren and Miller, 1988) with 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P3a' is the 'Morozovella angulata -Muricella albeari Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995).  An earlier version of subzone P3a used the FAD of Igorina pusilla top define the top of subzone, but this FAD is rare and reported to occur at the base of P3 (Berggren et al., 1995).  A working base of the Selandian substage (top of Danian) is the P2/P3 boundary (Berggren et al., 1995).

	P2	62.07		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P2' is the 'Praemurica uncinata -Morozovella angulata Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of P. uncinata to FAD of M. angulata;  equivalent to the same zone of Berggren and Miller (1988).  In general, this brief zone only encompasses 2-3 m in deep sea sites.

	P1	65.15		Paleocene Foram Zone P1 is the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina-Praemurica uncinata Interval Zone (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of Berggren and Miller, 1988) from LAD of P. eugubina to FAD of P. uncinata.  Subzone 'P1a' is the 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina - Subbotina triloculinoides Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995), which is an emendation of the former P1a 'Parasubbotina pseudobulloides' subzone of Berggren & Miller (1988), but the range is essentially identical.  Note that this is a "gap" zone (LAD of eugubina to FAD of triloculinoides).

	Pa	65.32		Paleocene Foraminifer Zone P-alpha is the Total Range Zone of "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina"   [Liu, (1993) emendation of Blow's (1979) "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Partial-range Zone"; in turn from Luterbacher & Premoli Silva's (1964) "Globigerina eugubina Zone"; however, Smit (1982) uses "G. eugubina Zone" as "P1a"].  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).

	P0	65.50		Basal Paleocene Planktonic Foraminifer Zone P0 (= Guembelitria cretacea, Partial range zone) is from Keller (1988; emendation of Smit, 1982).  Base = extinction of Rugoglobigerina, Globotruncana, Globotruncanella and associated taxa.  Top = FAD of P. eugubina.  See Berggren et al. (SEPM, 1995) for a page discussing the P0, P-alpha, P1 definition history and problems.  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).

	Dicarinella concavata	90.79	dashed

	Marginotruncana schneegansi	91.51		Turonian Planktonic Foraminifer zone "M. schneegansi" of Robaszynski's scale appears to be equivalent to "Marginotruncana sigali" foraminifer zone of Caron (1985), which is also begins with the LAD of H. helvetica.  In both cases, the zone is a "gap zone" (LAD at base, FAD at top).  However, the scheme of Caron (1985) has an overlying "Dicarinella primitiva" (base = FAD of D. primitiva), followed by Dicarinella concavata (base = FAD of D. concavata), with the base of D. primitiva approximately at base of Coniacian.  The scheme of Robaszynski places the FAD of D. concavata within the upper Turonian, therefore the D. primitiva zone is eliminated.

	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	93.41

	Pt1	1.77		Pleistocene Foram Zone Pt1 is the Globigerinoides fistulosus-Globorotalia truncatulinoides Interval Zone = LAD of G. fistulosus to Present, and characterized by G. truncatulinoides (Berggren et al., SEPM, 1995).  Pleistocene Foram Zone "Pt1a" is the 'Globigerinoides fistulosus -Globorotalia tosaensis Interval SubZone' (LAD of Glob. fistulosus to LAD of Glob. tosaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This may be equivalent to the lower part of Zone N23 of Blow (1979); however, the base of N23 boundary is FAD of Globigerina calida calida & Sph. excavata (Blow, 1969), but these datums are not in Beggren's compilations (1985 or 1995).  However, this event probably is just below the LAD of G. fistulosus (Intro. notes to ODP Leg 138 volume, p.28 - Table 6).

	PL6	2.39		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl6" is the 'Globorotalia miocenica -Globigerinoides fistulosus Interval Zone'  = [LAD of Globorotalia miocenica (in Atlantic) or LAD of Globorotalia pseudomiocenica (in Indo-Pacific)]  to  LAD of Globigerinoides fistulosus (Berggren et al., 1995).  It spans a portion of Zones N21 and N22 of Blow (1979).  The 'N22' concept of Blow (1969) is difficult to apply globally (reviewed in Berggren et al., SEPM, 1995).

	PL5	3.13		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl5" is the 'Dentoglobigerina altispira -Globorotalia miocenica Interval Zone' = LAD of Dento. altispira to LAD of Globorotalia miocenica (Berggren et al., 1995).  In Indo-Pacific, the top is LAD of Globorotalia pseudomiocenica, which is coeval to G. miocenica.  It spans the majority of Zone N21 of Blow (1979); although definitions for the base of N21 differ: FAD of G. tosaensis, LAD of G. altispira, LAD of S. seminulina.  These have an age range of about 0.3 m.y.

	PL4	3.14		Pliocene Foram Zone "PL4" is the 'Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina -Dentoglobigerina altispira Interval Zone' = LAD of Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina to LAD of Dento. altispira (Berggren et al., 1995).  It may span a portion of Zone N21 of Blow (1979).  This interval barely exists -- Berggren et al. (1995) estimated a duration of 30,000 yr; and this scale has about 20,000 yr!  It is essentially equivalent to the lower Kaena polarity subchron (C2An.1r).

	PL3	3.81		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl3" is the 'Globorotalia margaritae -Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina Interval Zone' = LAD of Globoturborotalita margaritae to LAD of Sphaerodinellopsis seminulina (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the upper portion of Zone 'N20' of Blow (1979).

	PL2	4.37		Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl2" is the 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes -Globorotalia margaritae Interval Zone' = LAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes to LAD of Gt. margaritae (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the lower portion of Zone 'N20' of Blow (1979).

	PL1	5.72		Pliocene Foram Zone PL1 is Globorotalia tumida/Globoturborotalita nepenthes Concurrent Range Zone = FAD G. tumida to LAD G. nepenthes (Berggren et al., 1995), with 2 subzones.  History of zone and regional events are summarized in Berggren et al. (1995).   Miocene/Pliocene Foram Zone "Pl1a" is the 'Globorotalia tumida/Globorotalia cibaoensis Concurrent Range SubZone' (FAD of Globorotalia tumida to LAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the majority of Zone 'N18' (or 'N19', which now begins BEFORE 'N18') of Blow (1979).  Lourens et al (GTS2004) also place base of "M14" at this level, but Berggren used an earlier event.  There is no major Foram datum to mark the base of the Pliocene.

	M14	6.14		Miocene Foram Zone "M14" is the 'Globorotalia lenguaensis -Globorotalia tumida Interval Zone' = LAD of Globorotalia lenguaensis to FAD of Globorotalia tumida (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to the uppermost part of Zone 'N17' of Blow (1979).  Note that this essentially a "gap" zone.

	M13	10.57		Miocene Foram Zone M13 is the Neogloboquadrina acostaensis/Globorotalia lenguaensis Concurrent Range Zone = FAD N. acostaensis to LAD of G. lenguaensis (Berggren et al., 1995); with 2 subzones.  Miocene Foram Zone "M13a" is the 'Neogloboquadrina acostaensis -Globigerinoides extremus/Globorotalia plesiotumida Interval SubZone' (FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis to FAD of Globig. extremus and/or Globorot.plesiotumida) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N16' of Blow (1979).  FAD of Globorotalia plesiotumida is difficult to determine under some conditions.  See extended discussion of subzone M13a/M13b limits in Berggren et al. (1995).

	M12	11.47		Miocene Foram Zone "M12" is the 'Neogloboquadrina mayeri -Neogloboquadrina acostaensis Interval Zone' (LAD of Neogloboquadrina mayeri to FAD of Neobloboquadrina acostaensis) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N15' of Blow (1979).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone, but is characterized by presence of Globorotalia menardii.

	M11	11.63		Miocene Foram Zone "M11" is the 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes/Neogloboquadrina mayeri Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes to LAD of Neogloboquadrina mayeri) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N14' of Blow (1979).

	M10	11.79		Miocene Foram Zone "M10" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi robusta -Globoturborotalita nepenthes Interval Zone' (LAD of Globorotalia fohsi robusta/lobata to FAD of Globoturborotalita nepenthes) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to upper portion of Zone 'N13' of Blow (1979).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone, which may explain its apparent brief extent (0.15 myr) in the global compilation.  However, in some regions, a further subdivision into 2 subzones can be made by Globigerinoides ruber.

	M9b	13.13		Subzone "M9b" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi robusta Total Range Zone' (initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi robusta to its LAD) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to uppermost portion of Zone 'N12' and lower 'N13' of Blow (1979).

	M8/M9	13.41		Miocene Foram Zone "M9" is the Globorotalia fohsi lobata-globorotalia fohsi robusta Interval Zone = initial evolutionary appearance of G. fohsi lobata to LAD of its descendant G. fohsi robusta (Berggren et al., 1995).  Base is same as base of N12 of Blow (1969, 1979), and top is probably near mid-N13.  Magnetochronologic calibration of boundaries is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy in DSDP Hole 563 by Wright and Miller (1992).  Two subzones -- Miocene Foram SubZone "M9a" was the 'Globorotalia fohsi lobata Lineage SubZone' (initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata to evolutionary FAD of its descendent Globorotalia fohsi robusta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to lower portion of Zone 'N12' of Blow (1979).  Miocene Foram Zone "M8" is the 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str. Lineage Zone' ( initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi s.str. to initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi lobata) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N11' of Blow (1979).  However, species "lobata" apparently combined with Fohsella "fohsi" in zonal scheme of Lourens et al. (in GTS2004).  This effectively removed the thin "M8" of Berggren et al., 1995.

	M7	14.24		Miocene Foram Zone "M7" is the 'Globorotalia peripheroacuta Lineage Zone' (FAD of Globorotalia peripheroacuta to the initial evolutionary appearance of Globorotalia fohsi s.str.) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N10' of Blow (1979).

	M6	14.74		Miocene Foram Zone "M6" is the 'Globorotalia peripheroronda Partial Range Interval Zone' (FAD of Orb. suturalis to FAD of Globorotalia peripheroacuta) (Berggren et al., 1995), and is equivalent to Zone 'N9' of Blow (1979).  This is a very brief interval the global compilation of datums.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; ref [b] which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6, but table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis". 

	M5	16.97		Miocene Foram Zone M5 is the Praeorbulina sicana-Orbulina suturalis Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995), FAD of P. sicana to FAD of O. suturalis; equivalent to Zone "N8" of Blow (1969, 1979.  Two subzones:  Miocene Foram Zone "M5a" is 'Praeorbulina sicana -Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. Interval Subzone' (FAD of Praeorbulina sicana to FAD of Pr. glomerosa sensu stricto) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This short subzone spans the lowermost part of the 'N8' zone.  The base of this zone is used to denote the base of the Langhian Substage (base of Middle Miocene), although this boundary may be more closely associated with the slightly younger FAD of Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str. (base of Subzone 'M5b'), which would render this substage about 0.3 myr shorter in duration.

	M4	17.54		Miocene Foram Zone "M4" is Catapsydrax dissimilis-Praeorbulina sicana Interval Zone (Berggren et al., 1995); equivalent to N7 of Blow (1969, 1979), and defined as LAD of C. dissimilis and/or C. unicavus to FAD of P. sicana; with 2 subzones.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone of 1 myr.  Miocene Foram Zone "M4a" is 'Catapsydrax dissimilis -Globorotalia birnageae Interval SubZone" (LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus to FAD of Globorotalia birnageae) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This subzone spans the lower part of the 'N7' zone.  Subzone "M4b" is 'Globigerinoides bisphericus Partial Range Zone' (FAD of Globorotalia birnageae to FAD of Praeorbulina sicana) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This short subzone spans the upper part of the 'N7' zone; but now is within the "overlying" M5!

	M3	17.59		Miocene Foram Zone "M3" is 'Globigerinatella insueta/Catapsydrax dissimilis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of Globigerinatella insueta to LAD of Catapsydrax dissimilis or Cat. unicavus) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is equivalent to the 'N6' zone.

	M2	21.12		Miocene Foram Zone "M2" is 'Catapsydrax dissimilis Partial Range Zone' (LAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globigerinatella insueta) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is equivalent to the 'N5' zone.  Note that this 3 m.y. zone is essentially a "gap" zone.

	M1	22.96		Miocene Foram Zone "M1" is the Globorotalia kugleri Total Range Zone (Berggren et al., 1983), defined by total range of G. kugleri; with 2 subzones.  Miocene Foram Zone "M1a" is 'Globigerinoides primordius Interval Subzone" (FAD of Globorotalia kugleri to FAD of Globoquadrina dehiscens) (Berggren et al., 1995).  This is approximately coeval to the 'N4a' subzone of Srinivasan & Kennett (1981).

	O6	26.83		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P22' (and 'N3') is defined as the 'Globigerina ciperoensis Partial Range Subzone' (LAD of Parabloborotalia opima opima to FAD of Globorotalia kugleri) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.

	O5	28.45		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P21b' [= Zone O5 of Beggren-Pearson '05) is defined as the 'Globigerina angulisuturalis -Paragloborotalia opima opima Interval Subzone' (LAD/LCO of Chiloguembelina cubensis to LAD of Para. opima) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller, 1988.  The base is at LAD of 'Chiloguembelina cubensis' (Berggren & Miller, 1988), however, Berggren (1995, SEPM) indicates the zonal boundary at "last common occurrence"(which he calls the "virtual LAD" instead of extinction of this taxon.

	O4	29.45		Oligocene Foram Zone P21 is the Globigerina angulisuturalis/Paragloborotalia opima opima Concurrent Range Zone (Blow, 1969; Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD to LAD, and is subdivided into 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P21a' (= Zone O4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is defined as the 'Globigerina angulisuturalis / Chiloguembelina cubensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD of G. angul. to LAD of Chil. cubensis) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).

	O3	30.42		Oligocene Foram Zone "P20" (= Zone O3 of Berggren-Pearson '05) (and "N1") is defined as the 'Globigerina sellii Partial Range Zone' (LAD of '"T." ampliaperatura' to FAD of 'Globigerina angulisuturalis') by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM), which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  Note that this is essentially a "gap" zone.

	O2	32.19		Oligocene Foram Zone 'P19' (= Zone O2 of Berggren-Pearson '04) is defined as the "'Turborotalia' ampliapertura Interval Zone' (LAD of Pseudohastigerina spp. to LAD of 'T.' ampliapertura) by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM); which is same as Berggren & Miller (1988).  "The historical vicissitudes associated with this zone" are discussed in Berggren & MIller (1988). 

	O1	33.88		Basal LAD = Definition of Eocene/Olig boundary

	E16	34.47

	E15	35.82

	E14	37.67

	E13	39.36		Eocene Foram Zone P14 (nearly same as E13 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Truncorotaloides rohri -Morozovella spinulosa Partial Range Zone' (LAD of G. beckmanni to FAD of P. semiinvoluta) (Berggren and Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.

	E12	39.80		Eocene Foram Zone P13 (= Zone E12) of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Globigerapsis beckmanni Total Range Zone' (FAD to LAD) (Bolli, 1957; Berggren et al., 1995).

	E11	41.36

	E10	42.60		Eocene Foram Zone P12 is the 'Morozovella lehneri Partial Range Zone' (LAD of M. aragonensis to FAD of G. beckmanni) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Therefore, it is essentially a "gap" zone.

	E9	45.00		Eocene Foram Zone P11 (= Zone E9 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Globigerapsis kugleri/Morzovella aragonensis Concurrent Range Zone' (FAD to LAD) (Berggren, 1969, but with complicated history; see redefinition in Berggren et al., 1995).

	E8	48.60		Eocene Foram Zone P10 (= essentially E8 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to the FAD of 'Globigerapsis kugleri') (Berggren & Miller, 1988; = Hankenina aragonensis Zone of Bolli, 1957).

	E7	50.30		Eocene Foram Zone P9 (= E7 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is the 'Planorotalites palmerae -Hantkenina nuttalli Interval Zone' (FAD to FAD) (Berggren et al., 1995).

	E6	50.77		Eocene Foram Zone P8 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the Morozovella aragonensis Partial Range Zone = 'gap' between LAD of Moro. formosa formosa to FAD of Planorotalites palmerae (Berggren & Miller, 1988; Berggren et al., 1995).  However, Aubrey et al. (1988, with Berggren as a co-author), places base of P8 at "FAD of Acarinina pentacamerata", and draws this boundary "approximately midway between the boundaries of Zones P6/P7 and P8/P9" (p. 735).  The simultaneous publication of conflicting definitions for base of Zone P8 (both with Berggren as an author, and neither discussing the change) is confusing.

	E5	52.57		Eocene Foram Zone P7 (= essentially E6 of Berggren-Pearson'05) is the 'Morozovella aragonensis/Morozovella formosa formosa Concurrent Range Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of Moro. aragonensis to LAD of Moro. formosa formosa.

	E4	54.52		Subzone "P6b" of Berggren (1995) scale (= Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson '05) is same as "P6c" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella formosa formosa/Morozovella lensiformis -Morozovella aragonensis Interval SubZone"; and from simultaneous FAD of Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Moro. lensiformis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.

	E3	55.09		Eocene Foram Zone P6 is the Morozovella subbotinae Partial Range Zone (redefined by Berggren et al., 1995) = "gap" from LAD of Morozovella velascoensis to FAD of Moro. aragonensis.  The P5/6a boundary was used in some publications to approx. Paleocene/Eocene boundary.  Near-basal Eocene Foram SubZone "P6a" of new Berggren (1995) scale is same as "P6b" of Berggren & Miller, 1988).  The complete name is "Morozovella velascoensis -Morozovella formosa formosa and/or Morozovella lensiformis Interval SubZone".  Note that this is a "gap" zone between LAD of 'M. velasoensis' and FAD of 'M. formosa formosa/lensiformis'.

	E2	55.58

	E1	55.73		Zone E1 and E2 of Berggren-Pearson '05 is attempt to find some events at P/E thermal excursion.  However, the marker species for base of E1 and E2 are rarely noted in previous studies; therefore, usage of these zones may be limited.

	P5	56.67		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P5', as defined by Berggren et al. (1995, SEPM) is the 'Morozovella velascoensis Interval Zone' = LAD of Glob. pseudomenardii to LAD of Moro. velascoensis.  This definition of P5 encompasses the former P5 and P6a zones of Berggren and Miller (1988).

	P4	60.19		Paleocene Foram Zone P4 is the Globanomalina pseudomenardii Total Range Zone  (Bolli, 1957a).  Three subzones are defined by Berggren et al. (1995).  Subzone 'P4a' is defined as the 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii / Acarinina subsphaerica Concurrent Range Zone' by Berggren et al. (1995) = FAD G. pseudomenardii to LAD of A. subsphaerica.  Either Glob. pseudomenardii or  Acar. subsphaerica defines P4a base.

	P3	61.72		Paleocene Foram Zone  P3  is the Morozovella angulata-Globanomalina pseudomenardii Interval Zone = FAD of P. angulata to FAD of G. pseudomenardii (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of P3 of Berggren and Miller, 1988) with 2 subzones.  Subzone 'P3a' is the 'Morozovella angulata -Muricella albeari Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995).  An earlier version of subzone P3a used the FAD of Igorina pusilla top define the top of subzone, but this FAD is rare and reported to occur at the base of P3 (Berggren et al., 1995).  A working base of the Selandian substage (top of Danian) is the P2/P3 boundary (Berggren et al., 1995).

	P2	62.07		Paleocene Foram Zone 'P2' is the 'Praemurica uncinata -Morozovella angulata Interval Zone' (Berggren et al., 1995) = FAD of P. uncinata to FAD of M. angulata;  equivalent to the same zone of Berggren and Miller (1988).  In general, this brief zone only encompasses 2-3 m in deep sea sites.

	P1	65.15		Paleocene Foram Zone P1 is the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina-Praemurica uncinata Interval Zone (defined in Berggren et al., 1995; emend. of Berggren and Miller, 1988) from LAD of P. eugubina to FAD of P. uncinata.  Subzone 'P1a' is the 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina - Subbotina triloculinoides Interval Subzone' (Berggren et al.,1995), which is an emendation of the former P1a 'Parasubbotina pseudobulloides' subzone of Berggren & Miller (1988), but the range is essentially identical.  Note that this is a "gap" zone (LAD of eugubina to FAD of triloculinoides).

	Pa	65.32		Paleocene Foraminifer Zone P-alpha is the Total Range Zone of "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina"   [Liu, (1993) emendation of Blow's (1979) "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Partial-range Zone"; in turn from Luterbacher & Premoli Silva's (1964) "Globigerina eugubina Zone"; however, Smit (1982) uses "G. eugubina Zone" as "P1a"].  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).

	P0	65.50		Basal Paleocene Planktonic Foraminifer Zone P0 (= Guembelitria cretacea, Partial range zone) is from Keller (1988; emendation of Smit, 1982).  Base = extinction of Rugoglobigerina, Globotruncana, Globotruncanella and associated taxa.  Top = FAD of P. eugubina.  See Berggren et al. (SEPM, 1995) for a page discussing the P0, P-alpha, P1 definition history and problems.  "Estimation of the age and duration of Zones P0 and P-alpha remains fraught with difficulty" (Berggren et al., 1995).





Foram Zone Marker	event		241/244/181		off

LAD

	Globorotalia tosaensis	0.61		Base Pt1b (Top Pt1a).  Astronomically tuned from ODP Legs 111 & 138. = Refs 1 & 2; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) had assigned as early Brunhes ; 0.65 Ma ; [a,e] = C1n.165; and noted that Pleistocene Foram Globorotalia tosaensis LAD is placed earlier, at Latest Brunhes-Jaramillo (0.8-1.0 Ma) by Caproniere et al. (1994).

	Globigerinoides fistulosus	1.77		Base Pt1a (Top PL6).  Astronomically tuned from ODP Legs 111 & 138 (Pacific); but LAD occurs earlier (1.88 Ma) at Atlantic Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 3 & 4; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) had assigned as just above Olduvai; 1.6 Ma [a] = C1r.3r.3

	Menardella (Globorotalia) miocenica (Atl.), Globorotalia pseudomiocenica (Indo-Pac)	2.39		Dual markers for Base of PL6 [or, due to LADs, the top of PL5.  (Atlantic reappearance of Pulleniatina near this level [ref. a]).  Astronomically tuned from ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 7-9; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Essentially same as Berggren et al (1995), who assigned to early Matuyama (below Reunion Subchron); 2.30 Ma [a] =C2r.3r.8. 

	Dentoglobigerina altispira	3.13		Base PL5 (or, due to LAD, top of PL4; and alternate for top of N20 -- see comments on PL5 Zone).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8-10; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  This LAD is reported as slightly earlier (3.19 Ma) in eastern Medit. (Refs 17, 22, 23) and much earlier (3.47 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 (Refs 1, 2, 5, 6) -- GTS2004 Neogene foram table.  Berggren et al. (1995) had similar assignment -- C2An.1r (Kaena); 3.09 Ma [a] ; {But 0.08 myr earlier in Medit. in late Mammoth, early Kaena; or about 3.17 Ma; ref. c,k).}, or a calibration of about C2Ar.1r.3.

	Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina	3.14		Base PL4 (or, due to LAD, then top of PL3, and alternate for top of Zone N20).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8-10; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  This LAD is reported as slightly earlier (3.17 Ma) in eastern Medit. (Refs 17, 22, 23) and much earlier (3.59 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 and 138 (Refs 1, 2, 5, 6) -- GTS2004 Neogene foram table.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as base Kaena; 3.12 Ma [b] = C2An.1r.0; and noted that Pliocene foram 'Sphaeroidinellopsis seminulina' LAD occurs about 0.1 m.y. earlier (top of Mammoth, or 3.21 Ma) in Mediterranean (refs. c,e,f,k).   NOTE that calibrations imply NO DURATION of Zone PL4 in Atlantic; and extremely brief (but earlier) elsewhere.  To avoid confusion on graphics, the base of PL4 has been lowered by 0.01 myr (3.14 Ma, instead of 3.13 Ma in Lourens et al., 2004 compilation).

	Hirsutella (Globorotalia) margaritae	3.81		Defines top of PL2; (was approx. base of Piacenzian stage in Berggren et al., 1995).  Cycle-calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean -- Refs 17, 23 & 24; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  This LAD is reported slightly earlier (3.85 Ma) at Atlantic Sites 95 & 926 (Refs. 8-10) in GTS2004 Neogene foram table.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as Gauss/Gilbert boundary; 3.58 Ma [a,o] = Base C2An.3n.  They noted that Pliocene foram 'Globorotalia margaritae' LAD is reported to occur 0.2 m.y. earlier (late Gilbert, or 3.79 Ma) in Mediterranean (refs. c,f,g,k).  The LCO occurs in the Mediterranean just above Cochiti Subchron (3.96 Ma) [ref. c,k]. 

	Globoturborotalita nepenthes	4.37		Base PL2 (or, due to LAD, Defines top of PL1; & N19/N20 boundary.).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8-10; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) assign as top Cochiti Subchron; 4.20 Ma [a] = C3n.1n.8.

	Globoquadrina dehiscens	5.91		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C3r (early Gilbert); 5.8 Ma [a-d] = C3r.15 [Datum levels in C3r scaled proportionally to match Berggren's relative spacing. ].   Miocene foram 'Globoquadrina dehiscens' LAD is calibrated in ODP Hole 588 in SW Pacific, and is synchronous in nearby Holes 586B,587,590 and in Indian Ocean (ref. c).  However, Berggren (1994 version of SEPM compilation) indicated that this LAD is apparently diachronous by about 1 myr from 3CBn (6.8 Ma) in subtropics to C3n.4r (5.5 Ma) in tropics (ref. a).   Miocene/Pliocene boundary interval Foram Zone "N18" is essentially non-existent in Berggren's table and GTS2004, because its base (FAD G. tumida) is now AFTER the base of N19 (FAD Sphaeroidinella dehiscens).

	Globorotalia lenguaensis (Atl. only)	8.97		Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 11 & 13; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  See NOTE above for Pacific LAD of ~6.14 Ma.

	Neogloboquadrina mayeri	11.47		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Miocene foram 'Neogloboquadrina mayeri' LAD is in the lower part of Buff Bay Formation at Buff Bay, Jamaica, 8 cm above FAD of 'Discoaster hamatus' (Berggren, 1993; Aubry, 1993).  In Bodjonegoro 1 borehole (Indonesia) these two datum levels occur together (personal observation, W. Berggren & M. Aubry). In North Atlantic Sites 558, 563 (ref. b) and 608 (ref. l) LAD of 'N. mayeri' was observed in close juxtaposition with FAD of 'N. acostaensis', essentially eliminating Foraminifer Zone N15 (=M12).  This has been varyingly interpreted as due to a hiatus in the North Atlantic (Aubry, 1993) or diachrony (ref. l,m).  Therefore, their assignment is C5r.2r; 11.4 Ma [b,l-n] = C5r.2r.2.  This LAD also defined their Base of Medit. zone Mt9.

	Fohsella fohsi s.l.	11.79		Formerly called 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta'.  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8 & 11; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globorotalia fohsi robusta' LAD is calibrated in Hole 563 (ref. b) = C5An.1n; 11.9 Ma [b] = top C5An.1n.

	Praeorbulina  sicana	14.53		Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as C5B.1n; 14.8 Ma [b] = base C5ADr.

	Catapsydrax dissimilis	17.54		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) calibrate Miocene foram 'Catapsydrax dissimilis' LAD as recorded in Holes 558, 563, North Atlantic (ref. b); and observed at top of polarity zone C5Dr in Hole 608 in interval of strong dissolution (refs. k,p) = C5Dn (upper); 17.3 Ma [p] or 18.3 [u] = C5Dn.9.

	Paragloborotalia kugleri	21.12		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) use this level as base of Medit. Zone Mt2, and note that Miocene foram 'Paragloborotalia (formerly Globorotalia) kugleri' LAD is recorded in Hole 516F, South Atlantic (ref. b), and at base of polarity zone C6An in Contessa Highway section (ref. q) = C6Ar; 21.5 Ma [b,q] = C6Ar.6.

	Globigerina euapertura	23.03		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Oligocene foram 'Globigerina euapertura' LAD is recorded near top of polarity chron C6Cn in Hole 748B and near base C6Cn in Holes 747A and 747B (ref. b) = C6Cn.2n; 23.8 Ma [b] = base C6Cn.2n.

	Paragloborotalia opima	26.83		Oligocene foram 'Paragloborotalia opima opima' (Berggren & Miller, 1988) defines top of P21.  This was called "G. opima opima" by Blow (1969), and is listed as only "P. opima" in Berggren 1995, SEPM). Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- The LAD is recorded between polarity zones C9n and C8n in Hole 516F (ref. a); individuals become significantly smaller above C9n and are not typical of 'P. opima s.s.' in Hole 558 (ref. 1; see also discussion in Berggren and Miller, 1988) = C9n (upper); 27.1 Ma [a] = C9n.9.

	Chiloguembelina cubensis (LCO)	28.45		Last Common Occurrence used to set age of Base-Chattian on SEPM chart and GTS2004.  Set equivalent to base of Chron C10n.1n.  Calibration from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- This LAD is recorded in mid-part of polarity zone C10n in Holes 747A (ref. a,e) 749 (ref. 2), in the mid-part of concatenated C9n and C10n in Hole 748B (ref. b), and associated approximately with C10n in Holes 689B and 690B (ref. d).  Whether this datum refers to extinction or strong reduction in numbers remains a moot point; records of discontinuouss presence in reduced numbers of this taxon into basal Miocene levels continue (ref. c) (Berggren et al., 1995).  Assigned as C10n (mid); 28.5 Ma [a,b,e] = 

	Turborotalia ampliapertura	30.42		Oligocene foram 'Turborotalia ampliapertura' defines top of P19, and was formerly 'Globigerina ampliapertura' (e.g., Blow, 1969).  Age-calibration from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- LAD is recorded in polarity zone C11r in Holes 516F and 558 (ref. a) and St. Stephen's Quarry, Alabama borehole (ref. d) = C11r; 30.3 Ma [a,f] = C11r.5.

	Pseudohastigerina naguewichiensis	32.19		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Oligocene foram 'Pseudohastigerina spp.' LAD defines top of P18, and is recorded in Holes 516F, 558, 563 (ref. a) and St. Stephen's Quarry, Alabama borehole (ref. f).   Earliest Oligocene foraminifer LAD of Psudohastigerina datum was noted as "C11r" in Berggren tables, but it seems to be a typographic error, because his age placement and chronologic order of this datum was at "32.0 Ma", hence in C12r.  Assignment is C12r; 32.0 Ma [a,f] = C12r.5.

	Hantkenina spp., Hantkenina alabamensis	33.88		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- the youngest of 3 normal "events" in polarity chron C13r in Contessa Highway section (refs. b,c) and above the normal "event" C13n.2n at Massignano (ref. d), where this LAD defines the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, and is dated radiometrically as 33.7 Ma.  Chron calibration = C13r; 33.7 Ma [a-d] = C13r.85.

	Turborotalia cerroazulensis	34.00		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene foram 'Turborotalia cerroazulensis" LAD defines top of P17, and is associated with youngest of 3 normal "events" in polarity chron C13r in Contessa Section (ref. b,c) and above normal "event" C13n.2n at Massignano (ref. d).  It is not absolutely clear whether the LAD of 'Hantkenina spp.' and 'T. cerroazulensis' group are synchronous or sequential.  Chron calilbration = C13r; 33.8 Ma [a-d] = C13r.75.

	Cribrohantkenina inflata	34.16		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene foram 'Cribrohantkenina inflata' LAD defines top of P16, and  is located between LAD of 'Gl. index' and 'T. cunialensis' and 'Hantkenina' in mid-part of polarity chron C13r at Massignano (ref. d) and just below youngest of 3 normal "events" in C13r in Contessa Highway section (ref.b) = C13r; 34.0 Ma [a-d] = C13r.6.

	Globigerinatheka index	34.47		One of the few taxa which has an LAD that is isochronous between low and high latitudes and provinces.  Age calibration from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene foram 'Globigerapsis index' LAD is essentially coincident with the LAD of 'Discoaster saipanensis' and 'Discoaster barbadoensis' and with lower of 3 normal "events" in polarity chron C13r in Contessa Highway section (refs. b,c).  This LAD occurs in younger part of polarity chron C13r on Kerguelen Plateau (Site 748) (ref. e) and appears to be globally reliable datum.  Recorded at a level in  Hole 689B (Weddell Sea) identified as C16n (ref. f), but an alternative interpretation of the paleomagnetic stratigraphy (ref. e) suggests this may be C15n, in which case the (apparent) latitudinal diachrony of the HO of Gl. index would be significantly reduced, if not eliminated, inasmuch as dissolution is strong across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary interval at high latitudes.  Chron assignment = C13r; 34.3 Ma [a-e] = C13r.3.

	Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta	35.82		Genus was formerly Porticulasphaera.  Scaling of Berggren-Pearson (2005) -- C15r; 35.3 Ma [a-c]; but Berggren-Pearson (2005) estimate as 35.8 Ma = C16n.2n.8.

	Morozovella crassata	37.67		M. crassata is the senior synonym of Morozovella spinulosa  Assignment by Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- C17n (lower); 38.1 Ma [a]; but 38.0 estimated by Berggren-Pearson (2005) = C17n.3n.6.

	Orbulinoides beckmanni	39.36		Defines top of P14 (or E13).  Age calibration by Berggren and Pearson (2005), which puts this LAD 0.1 myr higher than Berggren et al. (1995) = C18n (lower); 40.1 Ma [a]; but 40.0 Ma by Berggren-Pearson '05, following Wade (2004) using Site 1052 = C18n.2n.2.

	Guembelitrioides nuttalli	41.36		Age assignment by Berggren and Pearson (2005) = C19r; 42.3 Ma = C19r.25

	Morozovella aragonensis	42.60		Defines top of P11 or E9.  Age assignment by Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C20n; 43.6 Ma [a] = C20n.15.

	Morozovella subbotinae, Morozovella formosa	50.77		LAD of M. subbotinae defines top of E5, and LAD of M. formosa was top of P7.  Chron-age from Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene Foram Zone P8 base (LAD of 'Morozovella formosa') is drawn as uppermost C23n in chart in Aubry et al. (1988); and is shown with an age of 50.8 Ma in Berggren (1995, SEPM); but the source of these calibrations are not cited.  Assignment = uppermost C23n;  [m,h] = C23n.1n.8

	Morozovella velascoensis	55.09		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is puts this LAD 0.2 myr higher than Berggren et al. (1995) -- This LAD is recorded in younger part of polarity chron C24r2 in Hole 577 (ref. 9) and in mid-part C24r2 in Hole 577 (at 81.98 m) (ref. k).  However, paleomagnetic data (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86: 449, Fig. 7b) suggests a hiatus occurs between ~82m & 83 m in Hole 577, which would have the effect of depressing (rendering older) the HO of 'M. velascoensis'.  The HO of 'M. velascoensis' in Hole 577 is in Nannofossil zone CP8 (=NP9) (Monechi, 1985: 310, Table 5) which supports interpretation of hiatus in Hole 577, because the LO of 'M. valascoensis' is in Nannofossil Zone NP10.  Furthermore, Monechi (1985: p.307) indicates absence of extremely condensed sedimentation across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary interval.  Chron assignment here is C24r; 54.7 Ma [a]; but 54.5 Ma (mid-C24r) in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C24r.47.

	Globanomalina pseudomenardii	56.67		LAD defines top of Zone P4.  Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii' was called "Planorotallites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).  The LAD (= base Zone P5) is recorded in Hole 577 at either base of polarity chron C24r (ref. d) and or top C25n (ref. e) and in Hole 752 at top C25n (ref. f).  Juxtaposition/overlap of Gl. pseudomenardii LAD and Gt. subbotinae FAD is observed in Holes 465 and 758 (ref. g).  Chron assignment = C25n (top); 55.9 Ma [a,d-f] = base C24r.

	Parasubbotina variospira	59.99		LAD defines top of P4a (NEW version, Berggren et al, 2000).  Berggren and Pearson (2005) assignment = C26r; 59.2 Ma = C26r.57.

	Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina	65.15		Defines base of P1a.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina' in Berggren et al. (SEPM, 1995) was called 'Globigerina eugubina' in some other publications.  The LAD, defining the top of Zone P-alpha, is near the FAD of Pa. pseudobulloides; and Berggren et al. (1995) "admittedly somewhat arbitrarily" placed both events just below the polarity chron C29n/r boundary (p.146) = just below C29r/n boundary; 64.8 Ma [a] = C29r.95.

	Racemiguembelina fructicosa; LADs of other Cret. Forams	65.50		Top of Cretaceous

	Globotruncanita calcarata	74.47		SEPM'98 places at Chron C33n.85.

	Dicarinella asymetrica	83.53		Top of Santonian in SEPM'98

	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	91.51		Base of  P. percarinatus ammonite zone on SEPM'98 chart. 

	Rotalipora cushmani	93.95		SEPM'98 places arbitrary (?) at 0.4 myr before top of Cenomanian (= top of Rotalipora genus?).  Caron (1985) indicates base of this zone as FAD of W. archaeocretacea, rather than LAD of R. cushmani; and  this FAD is ~0.6 myr below.

	Ticinella bejaouaensis	112.50		Base of foraminifer Hedbergella planispira (defines base of H. planispira foraminifer zone) is greater than 32 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (base of cycle-controlled section) at Piobbico => older than 112.6 Ma.  This calibration is inconsistent, because the base of the H. planispira Zone is placed ABOVE base of P. columnata in Leckie et al. (2002), and in the middle of Lower Albian by Bellier et al. (2000).  However, Hardenbol et al. (1998) place the FAD of H. planispira below the FAD of P. columnata, as is indicated at Piobbico.  SEPM'98 had assigned as 1/2 of H. jacobi Zone. 

	Globigerinelloides algeriana	116.00		Top G. algerianus (= base of Hedbergella trocoidea or Planomalina cheniourensis Zone, depending on author; which is essentially a "gap" zone) = 116.0 Ma  (was 115.2 in Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 myr before top of nufieldiensis Zone.   "gap zone" (LAD at base; FAD at top).  Not included in all foraminifer zonations.

	Leupoldina cabri	120.70		Top L. cabri (= base of G. ferreolensis zone) = 120.7 Ma (was 118.2 in Leckie's table).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 1/5 from base of martinoides Zone. 

	Globuligerina oxfordiana, G. stellapolaris, G. caucasica, G. megamonica, G. calloviensis, Globigerina helvetojurassica, Globigerina terquemi. Globigerina gulekhensis	138.74		LADs are in the early Valanginian (Cretaceous), so the age is assummed as 1/3 up from the base of Valanginian

	Globuligerina balakhmatovae	165.72		LAD is in the Late Bathonian, the age is assummed as base of the H. (P.) retrocostatum Zone

FAD

	Truncorotalia (Globorotalia) truncatulinoides	2.00		Base N21&N22.  Age of 2.00 Ma calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean -- Refs 17, 20 & 21; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  However, this FAD occurs slightly later (1.93 Ma) in Atlantic Sites 925 & 926 (Refs. 7-9 in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix).  Berggren et al. (1995) assign as mid-Olduvai Subchron; ~1.90 Ma [p,a,f,g,h] = C2n.4; but note that Pliocene Foram "Globorotalia truncatulinoides" FAD is 2.0 Ma (just below Olduvai) in Atl-Medit; but is much earlier at 2.58 Ma (base of Matuyama) in SW Pacfiic.

	Menardella (Globorotalila) miocenica	3.77		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia, and an alternate definition for base of Zone N20-N21.   Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8-10; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned as C2An.3n; 3.55 Ma [a] = C2An.3n.1.

	Globoconella (Globorotalia)  puncticulata	4.52		Cycle-calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean -- Refs 17, 23 & 24; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) calibrate FAD of Pliocene foram 'Globorotalia puncticulata' to the Nunivak Subchron in the Mediterranean and elsewhere {4.50 Ma [b,c,e,f,g,k] = C3n.2n.85}.  They note that this is approximately the LAD of G. cibaoensis (~0.1 m.y. lower).

	Globorotalia tumida	5.72		Base PL1; N18 (but see Note on Glob. dehiscens).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8 & 11; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  This FAD is reported as later (5.57 Ma) at Pacific ODP Legs 111 & 138 (Refs. 2, 5 & 6) in GTS2004 Neogene foram table.  Berggren et al. (1995) notes that Miocene foram 'Globorotalia tumida' FAD (defining base of Berggren's zone Pl 1 = Base of "Pliocene" Foram Zonation; but datum is within latest Miocene) is dated in Hole 588 and synchronouse in other SW Pacific sites (586B,587,590) and in Indian Ocean (Holes 114,219,237,238) (ref.c).  This FAD is at a comparable position, but without paleomagnetic control, at Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau) (ref. d).  They assign as C3r (early Gilbert); 5.6 Ma [a-d] = C3r.45

	Globorotalia plesiotumida 	8.58		M13b base defined either by:  Glob. plesiotumida or Neo. humerosa. Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8 & 11; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globorotalia plesiotumida' FAD is recorded in Hole 806B (Ontong-Java Plateau; ref.e), but its FAD was difficult to define owing to questionable lower occurrences.  Berggren et al. (1995) assigned the FAD based on its lowest questionable occurrence, but its effective FCO may be about 0.5 m.y. higher (coeval with FAD of Globorotalia cibaoensis).  In Gulf of Mexico, the FAD is recorded in upper part of Nannofossil Zone NN10, similar to the lower Pacific occurrences, and overlaps the upper part of Discoaster bollii range with the FAD slightly below FAD of nannofossil Minylitha convallis FAD (Zhang et al., 1993; Aubry, 1993).  A similar FAD level is in Buff Bay, Jamaica (Berggren, 1993; Aubry, 1993).  Berggren et al. (1995) assign as (C4r.2r); (8.3) [e] = C4.2r.9.

	Globigerinoides extremus	8.93		Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 11 & 13; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) had at (C4r.2r); (8.3) [e] = C4.2r.9.

	Neogloboquadrina acostaensis s.s. -- base regular	10.57		Cycle-calibrated in Eastern Mediterranean -- Refs 31 & 32; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer table.  This FAD is reported younger (9.8 Ma) in Atlantic Sites 925 & 926 (Refs 8, 11, 13) in GTS2004 Neogene foram table.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Neogloboquadrina acostaensis' FAD is calibrated in Holes 558 and 563 (ref. b) and 608 (ref. l) in North Atlantic at the base of chron C5n = C5n.2n; 10.9 Ma [b,l] = C5n.2n.05.

	Globoturborotalita nepenthes	11.63		Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 11 & 13; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) notes that Miocene foram 'Globoturborotalita nepenthes' FAD occurs in North Atlantic Sites 563 (ref. b) and 608 (ref. l) and basal Buff Bay Fm., Jamaica (refs. m,n) = C5r.3r; 11.8 Ma [b,l-n] = C5r.3r.3.  They also use this FAD to define base of Medit. Zone Mt8.  

	Fohsella robusta	13.13		Formerly called 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta'.  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8 & 11; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) note that Miocene foram 'Globororotalia fohsi robusta' FAD is based on revised interpretation of magnetostratigraphy of Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies in ref.o = C5An.2n; 12.3 Ma [b,k] = C5An.2n.5.

	Fohsella "fohsi"	13.41		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia.  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 8, 11 & 12; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) assign Miocene foram 'Globorotalia fohsi s.str.' FAD is based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy at Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies at Holes 747A and 608 (see ref. o) = C5Ar.n1-2 (undiff.); 12.7 Ma [b,o] = C5Ar.2r.8.

	Fohsella "praefohsi"	13.77		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia.  The form 'Gt. praefohsi' seems intermediate between 'Gt. peripheroacuta' and 'Gt. fohsi s.str'.   Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 13; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al (1995) assigned Miocene foram 'Globorotalia praefohsi' FAD to a much younger level, based on reinterpretation of magnetostratigraphy at Hole 563, in turn based on stable isotope studies at Holes 747A and 608 (see ref. o) = C5Ar.n1-2 (undiff.); 12.7 Ma [b,o] = C5Ar.2r.8, but this FAD age-assignment was nearly identical to FAD of 'Gt. fohsi s.str.'

	Fohsella peripheroacuta	14.24		Formerly assigned as genus Globorotalia, and was used by Berggren et al (1995) to define base of Serravalian stage.  .  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al (1995) assigned as C5B.1n; 14.8 Ma [b] = base C5ADr = nearly 0.5 myr older than Atlantic-ODP cycle-strat assignment.

	Orbulina universa	14.74		Same as Orbulina suturalis? (see end of this comment).  Astronomically tuned from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al. (1995) used Orbulina "suturalis" (age of 15.09 Ma, based on mid-C5Bn.2n; ref [b] which had 15.1 Ma) to define base of Zone M6, but table in Lourens et al. (GTS2004) uses Orbulina "universa" (and there is no indication of a "suturalis". 

	Praeorbulina glomerosa s.str.	16.27		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al (1995) uses to define base of Medit. Zone Mt5b, and assign to C5Cn.1n (upper); 16.1 Ma [b] = C5Cn.1n.8.

	Praeorbulina sicana	16.97		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix -- however this implied revised calibration to polarity chrons would seem to invert Medit. zones Mt4b and Mt5a (this FAD of P. sicana) of Berggren et al. (1995).  Miocene Foram 'Praeorbulina sicana' of Berggren et al (1995) may be same as 'Globigerinoides sicanus' in table of Hodell & Woodruff (1994); however, their age estimates for the FAD differ by 0.7 m.y.  Berggren et al. (1995) assign age as C5Cn.2n (mid); 16.4 Ma [b] = C5Cn.2n.55.

	Globigeriantella insueta s.str.	17.59		Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix -- Note that this is much higher FAD than estimated calibrations by Berggren et al. (1995); which results in Zone M3 being nearly non-existent.  Berggren et al. (1995) -- Miocene foram 'Globigerinatella insueta' FAD has an inferred correlation to polarity chron (base of C5En) and corresponding age assignment = (C5En); (18.8 Ma)[t] or 18.85 Ma [u] = base C5En.

	Globoquadrina dehiscens	22.38		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995), who used to define Medit. Zone Mt1b -- Miocene foram 'Globoquadrina dehiscens' FAD is recorded in Holes 516F, 558, 563 (ref. b); South Atlantic (refs. r,s) and Contessa Highway Section (ref. q) = C6Br; 23.2 Ma [b] or 23.4 Ma [u] = C6Br.5.

	Paragloborotalia kugleri	22.96		Paragloborotalia (formerly Globorotalia) kugleri s.str. = M1 base; and approx. Oligocene/Miocene boundary [b,s].  Age estimated from Atlantic ODP Sites 925 & 926 -- Refs 12 & 14; in GTS2004 Neogene foraminifer appendix.  Berggren et al (1995) notes that Miocene foram 'Globorotalia kugleri' FAD is recorded in Holes 558, 563 (North Atlantic) and 516F (South Atlantic) (ref. b).   Miocene foram 'Globorotalia kugleri' FAD is recorded in Holes 516F, 558, 563 (ref. a of Oligocene set) = C6Cn.2n; 23.8 Ma [b] or 24.0 Ma [u] = base C6Cn.2n.

	Globigerina angulisuturalis	29.45		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is similar as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Oligocene foram 'Globoturborotalita (formerly Globigerina) angulisuturalis' FAD, which defines base of P21a, is recorded by Berggren and Miller (1988); Holes 516 and 558 (ref. a), 628A and 803C (ref. c) = C11n (upper); 29.4 Ma [a,c] = top C11n.

	Turborotalia cunialensis	35.26		Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene foram 'Turborotalia cunialensis' FAD defines base of P16, and is just above (i.e. younger than) LAD of 'P. semiinvoluta' (refs. b,c) = C15r; 35.2 Ma [b-d] = C15r.4.

	Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta 	38.03		Eocene foram 'Porticulasphaera semiinvoluta' defines base of P15, and has a brief overlap with 'Truncorotaloides' (Blow, 1979).  However, a brief, but distinct, separation of 'Acarinina' and 'P. semiinvoluta' is recorded in Nocchi et al. (1986, Fig. a).  Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C18n (upper); 38.4 Ma [a,b] = top C18n.1n.

	Orbulinoides beckmanni	39.80		Defines P13 (= E12) base.  Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C18r; 40.5 Ma [a] = C18r.66.

	Globigerinatheka kugleri	45.00		Age calibration by Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Not well calibrated  [m.n] -- Eocene Foram Zone P11 base (defined as FAD of G. kugleri) is not in table of Berggren (1995, SEPM).  His Eocene figure shows the P10/P11 boundary at about 60% of the distance from P9/P10 to P11/P12, or just above base of Nanno Zone NP15b (which has a magnetic calibration); and I have used this approximate scaling. Estimated by Berggren '95/'05 as 45.8 Ma = C20r.6.

	Guembelitrioides nuttalli, Hantkenina spp.	48.60		First occurrence of Hantkenina (base of P10) is current working definition of base of Lutetian Stage.  FAD of G. nuttalli is suggeste as alternate (base of E8) zonal datum by Berggrena nd Pearson (2005).  Age assignment of these events by Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C22n (upper); 49.0 Ma [a] = Base C21r (which makes a convenient global event).

	Acarinina cuneicamerata, Astrorotalia palmerae	50.30		Acarinina cuneicamerata = base E7, Astrorotalia palmerae = base P9.  Genus of Astro. palmerae was Planorotalites in Berggren et al, 1995.  Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) = C22r; 50.4 Ma [a] = C22r.33.

	Morozovella aragonensis	52.57		Defines P7 (=E5) base. Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Eocene foram 'Morozovella argonensis' FAD is recorded in Holes 550 (ref. g,h), 577 (ref. i,j) and in C23r in Hole 527 (ref. g).  The level adopted by Berggren (used shown here) is slightly older than that shown in Ref. a = C23n.2r; 52.3 Ma [g-j] = C23r.1.

	Morozovella formosa	54.52		Base of Zone P6b (= Zone E4 of Berggren-Pearson. 2005). This taxon is called only "Moro. formosa" in some other charts and papers, and was called Globorotalia formosa in some publications. Same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Early Eocene foram 'Morozovella formosa formosa' FAD is calibrated in Hole 577 (ref. i), and defined the P6b/c subzonal boundary of Berggren and Miller (1988).  Chron assignment = C24r; 54.0 Ma [i] = C24r.75.

	Pseudohastigerina wilcoxensis	55.58		Berggren and Pearson (2005) -- FAD is top of PE carbon-isotope excursion.  Following Berggren and Pearson, it is set as 0.15 myr above PE boundary (base of CIE) = C24r; 55.35 Ma.

	Acarinina sibaiyaensis	55.73		Berggren and Pearson (2005) -- marker for Paleo/Eoc.  One of "Excursion taxa" at PE boundary, therefore age is set equal to that PE age = C24r; 55.5 Ma = lower-mid C24r.

	Acarinina soldadoensis	57.30		Paleocene foram 'Acarinina soldadoensis' FAD defines base of Zone P4c of Berggren et al. (1995)/  Berggren and Pearson (2005), has same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- This datum is calibrated in DSDP Hole 384; and at comparable levels but without paleomagnetic control in Holes 465 and 758A, in association with FAD of Acar. coalingensis-triplex group and Acar. soldadoensis (Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).Paleocene Foram Zone 'P4' is the range of 'Globanomalina pseudomenardii'  (Bolli, 1957).  It is subdivided by the LAD of 'Acar. subsphaerica' and FAD of 'Acar. soldadoensis' by Berggren et al. (1995) to essentially correspond to foraminifer zones used in the Caucasus.  Chron assignment = C25r; 56.5 Ma [a] = C25r.9.

	Globanomalina pseudomenardii	60.19		Calibration by Berggren and Pearson (2005) is 0.2 myr older than the FAD in Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina psudomenardii' was called 'Planorotalites pseudomenardii' in Berggren & Miller (1988).  Calibration is from Hole 384, and at comparable levels but without paleomagnetic control in Holes 465 and 758A (Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).  The FAD is also recorded in the younger part of polarity chron C26r in Hole 577 (ref. 4) within Nannofossil Zone CP 5/6 (undiff.); but in polarity chron C25r in Zone CP5 (= NP6) in Hole 685 (ref. h) or in C26n in Zone CP5 (= NP5) in Hole 605 (refs. h,i; see also ref. b).  Chron assignment = C26r; 59.2 Ma [a,b,d,h,i]; but 59.4 Ma (mid-C26r) in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C26r.5.

	Igorina albeari	60.78		Paleocene foram 'Igorina albeari (=Muricella albeari = Globorotalia laevigata)' FAD defines P3b base.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- This FAD occurs approximately mid-way in Zone P3 in Holes 463 and 758A and in the mid-part of polarity chron C26r in Hole 384 (Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM) = C26r; 60.0 Ma [a] = C26r.3.

	Morozovella angulata, Igorina pusilla	61.72		A working definition for base of Selandian stage.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) is same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Morozovella angulata' FAD occurs in Hole 577 within lower part of polarity chron C26r (ref. a,e), but precise position difficult to determine because of absence of C27n (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86).  In Hole 384, this FAD occurs in upper C27n at <2m above FAD of 'Prae. uncinata') in Nannofossil Zone NP4.  In Holes 465 and 758A it is 2m above FAD of 'Prae. uncinata' (Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).  Chron assignment = C27n (upper); 61,0 Ma [a,b] = C27n.8.

	Praemurica uncinata	62.07		Paleocene foram 'Praemurica uncinata' (formerly 'Morozovella uncinata') FAD defines base of Zone P2.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) moved the FAD 0.4 myr older than in Berggren et al. (1995) on same mag-chron scale.  Notes from Berggren et al. (1995) -- The FAD occurs in Hole 577 (refs. a,e) just above a N->R polarity reversal (= polarity chron C28n); but Polarity chron C27n is missing (Bleil, 1985, DSDP Leg 86: p.446, Fig. 5; p.449, Fig 7B), and there may be a short hiatus at/near the level if FAD of this taxon in C27n (ref. b) is correct.  Alternatively C27n may be missing in the core break between cores 11 and 12 (ca. 101.8 m) in which case the FO of this taxon would be near the C27r/C28n boundary (see ref. b).  In Hole 384, it occurs at the same level as FAD of 'P. praeangulata' in Nannofossil Zone NP4 at the base of C27n, as well as in Holes 465 and 758A (see extended discussion in Berggren et al., 1995, SEPM).  Its FAD was considered equivalent to FAD of 'Praemurica praecursoria' (= 'Globorotalia (Acarinina) praecursoria' of Berggren & Miller, 1988) in an earlier draft by Berggren (1993), but 'praecursoria' was removed from his later versions. Chron assignment = C27n (lower); 61.2 Ma [a,b]; but 61.37 Ma (uppermost C27r) in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C27r.92.

	Globanomalina compressa, Praemurica inconstans	63.44		Berggren and Pearson (2005), which is nearly same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Praemurica inconstans' FAD is recorded in Holes 689B and 690C (ref. c) and 384 (ref. g).  Paleocene foram 'Globanomalina compressa' was called 'Planorotalites compresus' in Berggren & Miller, 1988.  FAD is recorded in Hole 384 (ref. g).  It also occurs at a comparable level (by correlation) in an interval with no polarity data just above incomplete polarity chron C28n in 750A-14-2, 44cm to 750A-14-2, 40cm (ref. f?).  Berggren & Miller (1988) "believe that G. compressus and Morozovella trinidadensis have approximately coeval FAD's"; therefore, this FAD of compressa was also base of Zone P1c.  Chron assignment = C28n (2/3rds from base); 63.0 Ma [a,b], but 62.87 Ma in Berggren and Pearson, 2005 = C28n.67.

	Subbotina triloculinoides	64.71		Defines P1b base.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram 'Subbotina triloculinoides' FAD is recorded in Hole 384 (ref. g) = C29n; 64.3 Ma [g] = C29n.6.

	Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina	65.32		Defines Pa ('alpha' Greek letter) base.  Berggren and Pearson (2005) uses same chron-age calibration as Berggren et al. (1995) -- Paleocene foram "Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina" FAD is estimated at about 0.030 myr after the end-Cretaceous event (Groot et al., 1990; discussed in Berggren, 1995, SEPM).  Chron assignment = C29r; 64.97 Ma [k] = C29r.7 (but fixed as 0.03 myr higher than base of P0).

	Abathomphalus mayaroensis	68.36		Chron C31n.40 (ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995).  This is the Tethyan FAD.  The FAD of A. mayaroensis seems to be older in North Sea (Paul Sikora, EGI database, 2005).  SEPM'98 correlation was approx. top of J. nebrascansis ammonite zone.

	Racemiguembelina fructicosa	69.62	dashed	DASHED:  Chron C31r.60  (ODP 171B table, in turn from Erba et al, 1995; which is nearly same as the C31r.66 placement in SEPM98).  NOTE: However, this FAD in Tethyan realm is calibrated in EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) as 67.5 Ma (2 myr young), which is ABOVE the FAD of A. mayaroensis => this Zone may not be applicable.

	Gansserina gansseri	72.35		SEPM'98 places at Chron C32n.40

	Globotruncana aegyptiaca	73.27		SEPM'98 places at Chron C32r.1n.50 (used here).  However, EGI database (Paul Sikora, 2005) calibrates Glob. aegyptiaca FAD at 72.7 Ma; about 0.5 myr younger.

	Globotruncanita calcarata	75.57		Polarity chron C33n.66.  Genus assigned as "Radotruncana" in Leg 171B table, but not in their Figure.

	Globotruncana ventricosa (consistent)	77.16		First consistent occurrence is a better marker for base of this Foram Zone.  EGI calibration is 77.6 Ma (Paul Sikora, 2005), which is 40% up in Chron C33n.

	Globotruncana ventricosa (rare)	79.54	dashed	DASHED at Top of Chron C33r (SEPM'98):  Rare FAD is not a useful datum, because it remains rare until mid-Middle Campanian (Paul Sikora, 2005); therefore consistent occurrence is a better definition of the zone.

	Globotruncanita elevata	83.53		Base of Campanian in SEPM'98.

	Dicarinella asymetrica	84.94		SEPM'98 assigns as Base of Middle Santonian (= base C. vermiformis ammonite zone).  D. asymtrica Zone is also range-zone of the index species.

	Dicarinella concavata	90.79	dashed	Dashed -- One-third up in P. hyatti ammonite zone in SEPM98; but ODP Leg 171B placed about 0.8 myr higher.

	Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica	93.41		Top of W. devonense ammonite zone (= base of P. flexuosum ammonite zone) on SEPM'98 chart.

	Rotalipora cushmani	95.33		SEPM'98 places at mid-point of Acanthoceras muldoonense ammonite zone. See note on R. reicheli.

	Rotalipora reicheli	95.68		SEPM'98 assigns as base of Middle Cenomanian.   Leg 171B table assigns the R. reicheli Zone with an age ~1 myr older, but with same duration.

	Rotalipora globotruncanoides	99.60		Base of Cenomanian (= primary marker of GSSP !! ).  Formerly called "R. greenhornensis"?  SEPM'98 had assigned as latest Albian (mid-point of uppermost subzone, M. perinflatum), but this was prior to GSSP definition of boundary.

	Rotalipora appenninica	100.94		Base of planktonic foraminifer Rotalipora appenninica is nearly the same horizon as base of Planomalina buxtorfi = base of that zone = 3.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (1.3 myr) => 100.9 Ma.  Leckie et al. (2002) indicate that R. appenninica FAD is just slightly older/below the FAD of P. buxtorfi, but Hardenbol et al. (1998) and Bellier et al., (2000) show the events to be simultaneous, which I will assume here.  The duration is 1.3 myr, nearly identical to the 1.5 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002) and 1.1 myr in Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Considering the thickness at Risou for this R. appenninica zone (in excess of 100 m; Kennedy et al., 2003 in press), I would have preferred a much longer time span.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Stoliczkaia dispar Zone.

	Planomalina buxtorfi	100.94		See below (primary control on Albian scale!).  Base of P. buxtorfi is also used as base of R. appenninica Zone on some scales.

	Rotalipora ticinensis	102.93		Base of Rotalipora ticinensis (= base of that zone) = 8.2 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (3.3 myr) on Piobbico cyclostratigraphy => 102.9 Ma.   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/5 from base of H. varicosum s.z.

	Rotalipora subticinensis	105.05	dashed	DASH:  SEPM'98 had assigned as FAD is at the base of the H. orbignyi s.z. of the M. (M.) inflatum. (used here).   Base of foraminifer R. subticinensis (base of that subzone) is not indicated in this Piobbico cyclostratigraphy, but Leckie et al. (2002) scales it within the B. breggiensis zone as 0.7 myr below the base of R. ticinensis, which would project as 103.6 Ma in GTS04, but would lose the relative proportions of Leckie's scale.

	Ticinella praeticinensis	106.42		Base of T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone  = 16.8 long-eccentricity cycles below top Albian (6.8 myr) => 106.4 Ma.  The duration is 3.2 myr, nearly the same as the 3.3 myr used in Leckie et al. (2002).  (NOTE -- Leckie et al., 2002, define the T. praeticinensis foraminifer subzone as the base of B. breggiensis Zone, in turn defined by the base of that species; however, the actual FAD of T. praeticinensis is below/older than the base of B. breggiensis according to both Leckie et al., 2002, and Hardenbol et al., 1998.  Because Premoli Silva is a co-author on both the Leckie et al., 2002 paper and on the Piobbico cycle stratigraphy paper, I'm assuming that the T. praeticinensis subzone is defined as base of B. breggiensis for this scaling.  In contrast, the zonal schemes of Hardenbol et al., 1998, and Bellier et al., 2000, do not have a B. breggiensis zone, but define the base of T. praeticinensis zone by the first occurrence of the name species.  What a mess.)  (primary control on Albian scale!)

	Ticinella primula	110.89		Base of foraminifer T. primula is 27.8 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (11.3 myr) in Piobbico cyclestrat => 110.9 Ma.  The T. primula zone extends up to 106.4 Ma, which is consistent with the 107.1 Ma Ar-Ar age within it (but from the middle of the 3 ammonite zones that it spans) obtained by Obradovich (1993).   (primary control on Albian scale!).  SEPM'98 had placed in middle of O. raulinianus s.z.

	Ticinella bejaouaensis	114.30		Base Ticinella bejaouaensis = 114.6 Ma (was 114.3 in Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had estimated as 3/5 up in D. nodosocostatum s.z.

	Globigerinelloides algeriana	119.00		Base Globigerinelloides algerianus = 119.0 Ma (was 117.1 on Leckie's chart).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 3/5 from base of martinoides Zone.

	Leupoldina cabri (consistent)	122.05		Consistent L. cabri (and calibration of FAD in SE France, etc.) is 85% up in D. deshayesi Zone (but see comment below -- rare occurrences are nearly to base of Aptian).  SEPM'98 had assigned as 2/3 from base of Deshayesites deshayesi Zone.

	Leupoldina cabri	124.50		Base of rare L. cabri (after downward extension by Premoli Silva et al., 1999) = 0.5 myr above base Aptian (125.0 Ma) = 124.5 Ma  (but, usually rare until higher; therefore the apparent FAD of L. cabri in the middle of the D. deshayesi ammonite zone in the Bedoule section (Moullade et al., 1998) is probably this delayed first occurrence).

	Globigerinelloides blowi	127.88		SEPM'98 had assigned as Estimated as about 1/4 below top of A. vandenheckii zone.

	Hedbergella similis	129.64		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of N. nicklesi Zone.

	Hedbergella sigali/delrioensis	136.76		SEPM'98 had assigned as 0.1 myr above mid-H. trinodosum s.z.   Most scales list this as H. sigali Foram Zone.

	Globuligerina hoterivica	142.30		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of M. paraminounum s.z.   Also called "Favusella" hoterivica

	Conoglobigerina gulekhensis	145.46		SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Berriasian

	Globuligerina balakhmatovae, G. bathoniana, Globigerina gulekhensis	168.86		FADs are in the Late Bajocian, the age is assummed as base of the G. (G.) garantiana Zone

	Globuligerina oxfordiana, G. stellapolaris, G. caucasica, G. megamonica, G. calloviensis, Globigerina helvetojurassica, Globigerina terquemi	170.23		FADs are in the Middle Bajocian, base of the S. (S.) humphriesianum Zone

	Nephrolithus frequens (low-lat.)	66.30		Leg 207 assigned as 0.8 myr before end-Cretaceous (used here) => closer to Boreal placement on SEPM98.  Boreal FAD is significantly (~1 myr) younger, as suggested on SEPM98 chart.  Low-lat shown on SEPM98 as mid-Chron C31n; but Leg 171B places ~1 myr younger.

	Micula murus	68.73	dashed	DASH:  Leg 207 assigned as 1.2 myr before end-Cretaceous (arbitrary equal-spacing of FADs of M. murus, N. frequens, and M. prinsii); ;but SEPM98 placement used in GTS04 and here (base Chron C31n).  DASHED -- Diachronous (p.16, ODP Leg 171B Expl. Notes). 

	Lithraphidites quadratus	68.98		SEPM98 shows as 0.1 myr after M. murus (used here).  However, GTS04 diagram (Fig.19.1) places Before (mid-way between M. murus and LAD of R. levis) -- used here for "GTS04".

	Uniplanarius trifidum	76.38		Also known as Quadrum trifidum.  Bralower et al. (1995) suggest this is coeval with FAD of foraminifer G. calcarata (about 0.8 myr younger), which may indicate uncertainty in Campanian inter-correlations.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as base of Late Campanian (base D. nebrascense zone).

	Uniplanarius sissinghii	77.38		Also known as Quadrum sissinghii.  Seems an arbitrary 1 myr below FAD of U. trifidum in Leg 171/207 tables.

	Ceratolithoides aculeus	78.92		FAD (from ODP 171/207) coincides with mid-B. perplexus (late) zone.

	Aspidolithus parcus parcus	83.53		FAD placed at base of Campanian.  Also called "Broinsonia parca parca" in some schemes.  BUT, base of preceeding A. parcus expansus is probably the one just above the boundary, and parca-parca occurs higher (J. Bergen 2005 pers. Commun.)

	Calculites obscurus	83.99		Leg 207 places at essentially Late/Middle Santonian boundary (base of D. bassleri zone)

	Lucianorhabdus cayeuxii	84.94		Estimates (SEPM, Leg 171/207) seem to converge on placement at Middle/Early Santonian boundary (base of C. vermiformis zone)

	Reinhardtites anthophorus	85.85		Leg 171B assigns to base of Santonian

	Micula decussata	86.96		Same as "Micula staurophora".  FAD is Late/Middle Coniacian boundary in Leg 171 and Tethyan SEPM column; BUT placed at Middle/Early Coniacian in Boreal SEPM column.

However, FAD ranges as low as lower-Lower Turonian and as high as lower-Middle Turonian (Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI]

	Quadrum gartneri	92.70	dashed	DASH:  Base of M. nodosoides Zone [Sudeep Kanungo, UCL thesis, June 2005; and pers. commun., Oct 2005 at EGI].  This is higher than the base of Turonian (Leg 171/207 placements) by 0.8 myr.

	Lithraphidites acutus, Microrhabdulus decoratus	95.56		SEPM'98 has assigned both as Middle of A. granerosense zone (used here); but Leg 207 projects age as base of Middle Cenomanian (~1 myr below)

	Corollithion kennedyi	97.93		SEPM'98 assigned FAD as middle of N. americanus Z.

	Eiffellithus turriseiffelii	102.93		Coeval with FAD of foraminifer R. ticinensis (Bralower-Leckie, 1997).  SEPM'98 assigned as Just below (0.15 myr) the base of H. orbignyi subzone.

	Eiffellithus monechiae	106.42		Coeval with FAD of foraminifer B. breggiensis by Bralower-Leckie (but see note on calibration of that datum).  Called E. cf. E. eximius in Bralower-Leckie chart.  Age assigned as 105 Ma in Leg 207 table (note on SEPM chart) => assigned as mid-A. intermedius ammonite subzone

	Axopodorhabdus albianus	109.06		Base of nannofossil A. albianus (called "P." albianus in Grippo et al., in press) is 23.3 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (9.5 myr) => 109.1 Ma.  This projects to base of P. steinmanni ammonite subzone, rather than to 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z. of SEPM98 column.

	Tranolithus orionatus  (=T. phacelosus)	109.77		Nomenclature is "phacelosus" in older literature, but others seem to be using "orionatus" now (e.g., Bralower, Burnett).  Bralower-Leckie charts places this FAD in middle of T. primula Foram Zone, but this would be inconsistent with cycle-scaling of overlying FAD of A. albianus (base of next higher NC zone), therefore placed at 25% up in this table.  SEPM'98 had assigned Tranolithus "phacelosus" FAD as 7/10 up in D. mammillatum Z., P. steinmanni s.z., or at same level as FAD of Axopodo. albianus.

	Hayesites albiensis	111.69		Middle of H. planispira Foram Zone (LAD of T. bejaouensis to FAD of T. primula) on Bralower-Leckie (GSA Bull., 1997) chart.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as top of N. nolani Z., D. nodosocostatum s.z.

	Prediscosphaera columnata	112.02		Base of nannofossil P. columnata is 30.6 long-eccentricity cycles below top of Albian (12.4 myr) => 112.0 Ma = working definition for base of Albian.  (Primary control on Aptian-Albian interval!)    SEPM'98 has assigned as FAD is 2/10 up in L. tardefurcata Z., L. schrammeni s.z.

	Eprolithus floralis 	121.90		Base E. floralis (base NC7A) fixed at 121.9 Ma  (was 119.0 Ma in Leckie's chart), which sets base of D. furcata Zone.  Time-control point for scaling E. Aptian.  SEPM'98 had FAD projected to 8/10 up in D. forbesi Zone (= D. weisi)  on SEPM chart; but now projects much higher (base of D. furcata Zone)

	Rhagodiscus gallagheri	124.59		40% up in D. tuarkyricus (D. oglanlensis) Zone.   [NOTE: New scaling for E. Aptian makes the interval between FADs of R. angustus and E. floralis as 2 myr, instead of only 1 myr.]  

	Hayesites irregularis 	125.11		Also called Rucinolithus irregularis.   95% up in Chron M1n.   SEPM'98 had assigned as just below (0.1 myr) the base of Aptian.

	Flabellites oblongus (consistent)	126.12		50% up in Chron M1n (Bralower, 1993).  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD is 1/10 up in A. vandenheckii Z.

	Rucinolithus terebrodentarius, Rucinolithus windleyae	131.44		Put as upper (80% up) Chron M7n.  Before, had as Middle of Chron M7r (J. Bergen), which is slightly lower (0.4 myr) than placement on SEPM chart.  The two taxa are combined by some specialists.  Bralower subdivides NC5 with this datum.  SEPM'98 had assigned as Base of Chron M6r when correlated with Italian magnetostratigraphy or just below the top of B. balearis Z. when correlated with French ammonites (which are similar placements, when using the GTS2004 time scale).

	Lithraphidites bollii	133.07		25% up in C. loryi Zone.  Bralower uses this to subdivide NC4, but it seems that base of NC4 (LAD of T. verenae) is ABOVE this L. bollii FAD.  SEPM'98 had assigned LAD as 2/10 up in C. loryi Z.

	Eiffellithus striatus	135.13		Middle of H. trinodosum s.z. (of N. pachydicranus Zone).  With revised zonal scheme, this essentially is base of C. furcillata subzone.

	Eiffellithus windii	138.08		10% up in B. campylotoxus Zone.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. pertransiens Zone.  Note:  "SEPM98" age is different than actual SEPM chart, due to change in extent of T. pertransiens.

	Calcicalathina oblongata	140.24		20% up in Chron M14r.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 7/10 up in T. otopeta Zone, which would shift to Berriasian, due to working-group change in boundary.

	Retecapsa angustiforata	144.82		Base of P. grandis subzone (J. Bergen's calibration).    SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as 8/10 up in T. occitanica Z., D. dalmasi s.z.  Alternate name was C. angustiforatus.

	Nannoconus kamtneri, Nannoconus steinmannii	145.14		30% up in Chron M17r (Bralower), which would be AFTER base of CC1; but Bergen correlated to about 50% up in B. jacobi s.z. (used here).  However, Bergen's version might be N. steinmanii minor of Bralower.  SEPM'98 had assigned FAD as middle of B. jacobi Z., P. grandis s.z.

Such a cataclysm could have wiped out mammoths and other large mammals, abruptly ended the Paleo-Indian Clovis culture, and triggered a millennium-long return to near-glacial cold (Younger Dryas interval)." (review by Kerr, 2 Jan 2009, Science 323:26).  Main supporting observations are an anomalous black organic-rich mat with nanodiamonds near the base. "Earth's collision with a rare swarm of carbonaceous chondrites or comets at the onset of the Younger Dryas cool interval, producing multiple airbursts and possible surface impacts, with severe repercussions for plants, animals, and humans in North America." (Kennett et al., 2 Jan 2009, Science 323:94) Diam.(km): shower, maybe small craters

Australia Field centered about N 1° E 104°. Age = 803 +/- 3 ka (Ar/Ar; Yamei et al., 2000).  Largest tektite field (10% Earth's surface), implying a crater 30-110 km diameter; but none has been located.  Relative densities and Muong Nong-type tektites suggest a crater location in Vietnam or Thailand. Diam.(km): no crater found

	Chesapeake Bay (Virginia, USA)	35.5		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/chesapeake.htm">Chesapeake</a>]. Virginia, U.S.A. N 37°17' W 76°1'. Age is 35.5 +/- 0.3.  The bolide impacted at a speed of many kilometers per second, punching a deep hole through the sediments and into the granite continental basement rock. The bolide itself was completely vaporised, with the basement rock being fractured to depths of 8 kilometers, and a 'peak ring' being raised around it.  Extensive tektite strewnfield beyond.  The deep crater, 38 km across, is surrounded by a flat-floored terrace-like ring trough with an outer edge of collapsed blocks forming ring faults. The entire circular crater is observed at about 85 km in diameter and 1.3 km deep, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon. Diam.(km): 90

The Popigai crater in Siberia, Russia is tied with Manicouagan Reservoir as the 4th largest impact crater on Earth. A large bolide impact created the 100-kilometer diameter crater at 35.7 +/- 0.2 Ma during the late Eocene (Priabonian stage). The shock pressures from the impact instantaneously transformed graphite in the ground into diamonds within a 13.6 kilometer radius of the impact point. Diamonds are usually 0.5 to 2 millimeters in diameter; a few exceptional specimens are 10 millimeters in size. The diamonds not only inherit the tabular shape of the original graphite grains but they additionally preserve the original crystal's delicate striations. Diam.(km): 100

The impact caused some of the largest megatsunamis in Earth's history. A cloud of dust, ash and steam would have spread from the crater, as the impactor burrowed underground in less than a second. Excavated material along with pieces of the impactor, ejected out of the atmosphere by the blast, would have been heated to incandescence upon re-entry, broiling the Earth's surface and igniting global wildfires; meanwhile, shock waves spawned global earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things to survive in. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would have led to a dramatic greenhouse effect. Another consequence of the impact is that sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. Diam.(km): 170

	Kara (n. Urals, Russia)	70.3		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/kara.htm">Kara</a>]. Russia N 69°6' E 64°9'. Age is 70.3 +/- 2.2. The Kara crater lies in the southeastern end of the Yugorsky Peninsula, while the Ust-Kara site lies offshore, 15 km east of the small Kara or Karskaya Guba inlet. It was formerly believed that these two sites were two separate craters and that they formed a twin impact structure from a large-scale meteorite hit in the late cretaceous. However, it seems that the Ust-Kara site does not exist as a separate site. Apparently, the Suevite outcrops of the Ust-Kara impact structure are only a part of the Kara impact structure.

Age of top of Ontong Java Plateau is about 122 Ma.  Ingle and Coffin (2004; see Link) suggest that initiation of the most voluminous large igneous province (LIP) on Earth, at ~ 60 million cubic km, may have been massive decompression melting in the upper mantle (300 km depth or more) from a 20 km-diameter bolide.

Fifth largest impact crater known on earth.  Manicouagan Reservoir lies within the remnant of an ancient eroded impact crater (astrobleme). The crater was formed following the impact of a 5 kilometres (3 miles) diameter asteroid which excavated a crater originally about 100 km (62 mi) wide although erosion and deposition of sediments have since reduced the visible diameter to about 72 km (45 mi).

	Araguainha (Brazil)	244.4		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/araguainha.htm">Araguainha</a>]. Brazil S 16°47 W 52°59'. Age is 244.40 +/- 3.25. It is a 40-km wide eroded complex crater, formed near to the Permian-Triassic boundary (245 Ma.), when a celestial body struck what was probably a shallow sea. Diam.(km): 40

	Charlevoix (Quebec, Can.)	342.0		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/charlevoix.htm">Charlevoix</a>]. Quebec, Canada N 47°32' W 70°18'. Age is 342 +/- 15; pre-1977 K-Ar, Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr ages recalculated using the decay constants of Steiger and Jager (1977) Ages in millions of years (Ma) before present. The projectile was probably a stony asteroid, at least two kilometres in diameter, and weighing an estimated 15 billion tonnes. The Mont des Éboulements, situated in the exact centre of the crater, is interpreted as the central uplift, a consequence of elastic rebound. The crater is classified as a multi-ringed basin with a central uplift. Diam.(km): 54

	Woodleigh (Shark Bay, W. Aust.)	364.0		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/woodleigh.htm">Woodleigh</a>]. Western Australia S 26º3' E 114º39'. Age is 364 +/- 8.  Could be as much as 100 km in diameter, based on extrapolation of central-peak; but contentious. Diam.(km): 40

	Siljan (Sweden)	376.8		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/siljan.htm">Siljan</a>]. Sweden N 61°2' E 14°52'. Age is 376.8 +/- 1.7. One of the most ancient of all known terrestrial meteor craters, the 51-km-diameter Siljan crater in Sweden is about 368 Ma. Though it has largely been eroded, four lakes (Siljan, Orsasjön, Skattungen and Oresjön) mark its initial boundaries. Diam.(km): 52

	Middle Ordovician suite	467.0	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n1/full/ngeo.2007.37.html">Ordov (Nature08)</a>]. Global shower in Middle to early Late Ordovician . From Schmitz, B., et al. (2008, Nature Geoscience 1: 49-53):  Enhanced cratering and meteor flux coincides with main phase of Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (at about the Arenig-Llanvirn boundar; mid-Darriwillian; about 466 Myr ago).  Chondrule age is 470 +/- 6 Ma (Ar-Ar dating on chondrules in Middle Ordov. limestone in Sweden); identical within uncertainties to the age of 467.3 +/-1.6 Ma (lower Lenodus variabilis conodont zone) for the beds with fossil meteorites in Sweden and China (GTS04 time scale).  Breakup of a parent L-chrondrite asteroid may have caused this extended shower. Diam.(km): scattered craters

	Acraman (S. Aust.)	590.0	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/Acraman.htm">Acraman</a>]. South Australia S 32º1' E 135º27'. Age is ~590. An evolutionary radiation within marine microorganisms (acritarchs) occurs just above the level as the ejecta layer, and some authors believe there may be a connection. The crater is deeply eroded and its original size must be inferred by indirect means. Some authors estimate an original diameter of up to 85-90 km, while other suggest a smaller size, perhaps only 35-40 km, closer to that of the depression in which Lake Acraman is centered. The larger size estimate would imply an energy release of 5.2 x 10^6 megatons of TNT. The ejecta contains shocked minerals and small shatter cones, is composed of rock similar in age and composition to that at the crater, and is associated with an iridium anomaly suggesting contamination with extraterrestrial material.  Diam.(km): 90

	Beaverhead (Montana, USA)	900.0	dashed	For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/beaverhead.htm">Beaverhead</a>]. Montana, U.S.A. N 44°36' W 113°0'. Impact is estimated to have occurred about 900 Ma, although its age is only pinned to >600 Ma. The 60-km-diameter Beaverhead Impact Structure is one of only eight known bolide impacts with craters over 50 km in diameter. Scientists now believe that the center of the Beaverhead Impact Crater is in Idaho within the Salmon-Challis National Forest.  It is 60 km in diameter and  Tectonism has broken up regions of the original shocked rocks and dispersed them as large discrete areas across the geological landscape. Diam.(km): 60

	Sudbury (Ontario, Can.)	1850.0		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/sudbury.htm">Sudbury</a>]. Ontario, Canada N 46°36' W 81°11'. Age is 1850 +/- 3. Sudbury Basin may be the second largest crater on Earth, after the 300 km Vredefort crater in South Africa, and larger than the 170 km Chicxulub crater in Yucatán, Mexico.  The current Sudbury Basin i(62 km long, 30 km wide, 15 km deep) is believed to be a smaller portion of a 250 km round crater that the bolide originally created.    It was created by a 10 km meteorite impact, 1.85 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era. Debris was scattered over an area of 1.6 million square kilometers and travelled over 800 kilometers away.  Subsequent geological processes have deformed the crater into the current smaller oval shape.  Diam.(km): 250

	Vredefort (S. Afr.)	2023.0		For details click [<a href="http://www.unb.ca/passc/ImpactDatabase/images/vredefort.htm">Vredefort</a>]. South Africa S 27º0' E 27º30'. Age is 2023 +/- 4. The asteroid that hit Vredefort is one of the largest to ever impact Earth, estimated at over 10 km (6 miles) wide. It is believed by many that the original size of the impact structure could have been 250 km in diameter, or possibly larger. This makes Vredefort the largest known impact structure on Earth. Diam.(km): 300
