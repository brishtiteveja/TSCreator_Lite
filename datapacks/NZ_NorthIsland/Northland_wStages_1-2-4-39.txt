They unconformably overlie Miocene and older rocks. The sediments are heterogeneous and thickness is highly variable, usually within the range 5-60 m but much thicker in places; up to 700 m of Tauranga Group may be present in the rift beneath the Hauraki Plains and exploration drilling has shown a thickness of up to 600 m in the northwestern Hamilton lowlands..

Te Kuiti Group is a predominantly transgressive sequence of basal coal measures, overlain by marginal marine to outer shelf calcareous mudstone, calcareous sandstone and bioclastic limestone, of Late Eocene to earliest Miocene age. In the northern Waikato the group is up to 500 m thick and it is about 250 m thick at Hikurangi, in Northland.  .

The typical lithology is siltstone or mudstone, locally with glauconitic sandstone and, in one area, a thin, muddy high sulphur coal. It overlies and locally overlaps Waikato Coal Measures and is up to  200 m thick. It was deposited in shallow to marginal marine settings, in Early Oligocene time..

LITHOLOGY = Waitakere Group DESCRIPTION = Predominantly submarine basaltic and andesitic volcanic complexes of the Early Miocene Waitakere arc lie along the western margin and west of the Northland peninsula as far south as the Manukau Harbour. Waitakere Group rocks exposed on land in western Northland include massive and pillow lavas, breccia, tuff, volcaniclastic sandstone and mudstone. At Waipoua, numerous and extensive flows of subaerial basalt are separated by thin beds of airfall tuff and lapilli; the flows overlie a marine planation surface which truncates the underlying Northland Allochthon and the Early Miocene Otaua Group. Remnants of Early Miocene andesitic stratovolcanoes and volcaniclastic ring plain facies present in eastern Northland (e.g. Hen and Chicken Islands, Whangarei Heads, Whangaroa) and at Coromandel Peninsula are assigned to the coeval Coromandel Group..

LITHOLOGY = Northland Allochthon DESCRIPTION = The basal dcollement is typically overlain by mlange, in turn succeeded by micritic limestone, calcareous mudstone and calcareous glauconitic sandstone, of Eocene to earliest Miocene age (Motatau Complex). Mid Cretaceous to Eocene Mangakahia Complex rocks, predominantly quartzofeldspathic sandstone and Whangai calcareous and noncalcareous shale, overlie the calcareous facies and the highest thrust sheet (Tangihua Complex) is of mid Cretaceous to Paleocene pillow basalt, massive basalt, breccia, siliceous mudstone, minor limestone, gabbro sills and small stocks, and at North Cape, serpentinised peridotite and cumulate gabbro.  Almost all the Cretaceous and much of the Paleogene rocks which outcrop in onshore Northland are allochthonous; they comprise a series of at least six rootless nappes, emplaced southwestward by obduction in Late Oligocene to Early Miocene time. The source of the nappes is inferred to have been the former passive margin clastic wedge which lay outboard of what is now northeastern Northland. The Northland Allochthon overlies Mesozoic basement and the in place Te Kuiti Group sequence and is commonly overlain by Early Miocene beds (e.g., Parengarenga Group, Waitemata Group, Coromandel Group). Offshore seismic surveys show the western limit of the allochthon is up to 80 km beyond the coast; the allochthon is typically 2000-3000 m thick and locally thicker than 4000 m; it is at least 2800 m thick in the petroleum well Waimamaku-2. The southern limit of the allochthon is about 20 km north of central Auckland. The original (pre-erosion) volume of the allochthon has been estimated at 100,000 cubic kilometres..

LITHOLOGY = Waitemata Group DESCRIPTION = The Early Miocene Waitemata Group strata of south Auckland, Auckland and Northland unconformably overlie Mesozoic basement, Te Kuiti Group, and Northland Allochthon. Several subgroups are differentiated. In the Auckland area the group comprises a basal transgressive sequence of coarse-grained lithic shelly facies (Kawau Subgroup) that passes rapidly upward into bathyal turbidites with redeposited conglomerates (e.g. Albany Conglomerate) and intercalated volcaniclastic mass flow deposits (Parnell Grit).  Typical lithologies are thick-bedded volcaniclastic turbidites (Pakiri facies), turbidites poor in volcanic detritus (East Coast Bays facies and Meremere Subgroup),and turbidite sandstones of mixed provenance (Blockhouse Bay and Cornwallis facies). The thickness of Waitemata Group sedimentary rocks is in the range hundreds to thousands of metres..

LITHOLOGY = Kamo Coal Measures  DESCRIPTION = The 0-100 m thick Kamo Coal Measures (of the Te Kuiti Group) outcrop intermittently in eastern Northland between Kerikeri in the north and the Brynderwyn Hills, a distance of about 100 km. The known occurrences of thick coal measures indicate accumulation mainly in WSW-ENE oriented half-grabens. The coal measures overlie Mesozoic basement unconformably and include conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone, with 1-2 seams of sub-bituminous A to bituminous C coal. Palynofloras indicate a Late Eocene age..

LITHOLOGY = Mangapa Mudstone DESCRIPTION = In Northland, north of the Waipapa horst and east of the Mangapa Fault Zone, Ruatangata Sandstone which unconformably overlies basement is suceeded by the Mangapa Mudstone (of Te Kuiti Group); west of the fault Mangapa Mudstone directly overlies basement. It typically comprises massive to poorly stratified calcareous blue-grey mudstone, deposited at mid shelf to outer bathyal depths in Late Eocene time. The maximum known thickness is ca. 170 m but the original thickness was probably greater, since the upper contacts are either the modern day erosion level or the basal thrust plane of the cross-cutting Northland Allochthon..

LITHOLOGY = Northland Allochthon DESCRIPTION = The basal dcollement is typically overlain by mlange, in turn succeeded by micritic limestone, calcareous mudstone and calcareous glauconitic sandstone, of Eocene to earliest Miocene age (Motatau Complex). Mid Cretaceous to Eocene Mangakahia Complex rocks, predominantly quartzofeldspathic sandstone and Whangai calcareous and noncalcareous shale, overlie the calcareous facies and the highest thrust sheet (Tangihua Complex) is of mid Cretaceous to Paleocene pillow basalt, massive basalt, breccia, siliceous mudstone, minor limestone, gabbro sills and small stocks, and at North Cape, serpentinised peridotite and cumulate gabbro.  Almost all the Cretaceous and much of the Paleogene rocks which outcrop in onshore Northland are allochthonous; they comprise a series of at least six rootless nappes, emplaced southwestward by obduction in Late Oligocene to Early Miocene time. The source of the nappes is inferred to have been the former passive margin clastic wedge which lay outboard of what is now northeastern Northland. The Northland Allochthon overlies Mesozoic basement and the in place Te Kuiti Group sequence and is commonly overlain by Early Miocene beds (e.g., Parengarenga Group, Waitemata Group, Coromandel Group). Offshore seismic surveys show the western limit of the allochthon is up to 80 km beyond the coast; the allochthon is typically 2000-3000 m thick and locally thicker than 4000 m; it is at least 2800 m thick in the petroleum well Waimamaku-2. The southern limit of the allochthon is about 20 km north of central Auckland. The original (pre-erosion) volume of the allochthon has been estimated at 100,000 cubic kilometres..

Domes of rhyolite and small plutons of tonalite, quartz diorite, monzodiorite and granodiorite are minor components.

LITHOLOGY = Predominantly muddy. The Giant Foresets formation consists of a series of striking clinoform-shaped, basinward-dipping seismic packages. The formation can be divided informally into foreset (slope facies), topset (shelf), and bottomset (basin-floor) facies. Each successive clinoform represents the transient position of the shelf-slope, basin-floor profile as the continental margin wedge prograded basinward during the Pliocene and Pleistocene.

LITHOLOGY = The Moki Formation is commonly comprised of interbedded sandstones, siltstone, and mudstones, with common limestone stringers and concretion horizons.

The formation was deposited in bathyal depositional environments over most of the basin, although equivalent fine-grained shelf deposits of Mid- to Late-Miocene age are present in the southeast.

LITHOLOGY = The North Cape Formation was deposited in shallow-marine, paralic, and terrestrial environments. Shallow-marine siltstones and coastal sandstones and silty sandstone are the predominant lithologies, but coal measures are prominent locally (Wainui and Puponga memebers).  It reflects a major south-directed transgression at the end of the Cretaceous, in which the sea flooded across coastal flood plains and probed into fault controlled alluvial valleys to form an interconnected system of narrow tidal embayments.
